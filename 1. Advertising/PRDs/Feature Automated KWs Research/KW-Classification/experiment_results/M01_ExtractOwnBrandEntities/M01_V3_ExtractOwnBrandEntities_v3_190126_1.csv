Focus on mistakes real customers make when typing fast\n\n**Example typo generation (following priority):**\n- Brand \""Bellroy\"" \u2192 `Bellroy`, `bellroy`(case), `Belroy`(missing), `Bellory`(swap), `Bellray`(vowel)\n- Brand \""Pyrex\"" \u2192 `Pyrex`, `pyrex`(case), `Prex`(missing), `Pirex`(phonetic), `Pyerx`(swap)\n- Brand \""Bose\"" \u2192 `Bose`, `bose`(case), `Bsoe`(swap), `Bosee`(doubled)\n\n### \ud83d\udd34 ANTI-HALLUCINATION CONSTRAINT (CRITICAL)\n\n**Each typo must be traceable to EXACTLY ONE edit operation from the original brand.**\n\nValid single-edit operations:\n1. **Double ONE existing letter**: Pyrex \u2192 Pyrrex (doubled 'r')\n2. **Drop ONE letter**: Pyrex \u2192 Prex (dropped 'y')\n3. **Swap TWO adjacent letters**: Pyrex \u2192 Pyerx (swapped 're')\n4. **Replace with keyboard-adjacent key**: Pyrex \u2192 Pytex (r\u2192t adjacent)\n5. **Replace with phonetically similar**: Pyrex \u2192 Pirex (y\u2192i similar sound)\n\n**\ud83d\udeab FORBIDDEN (These are HALLUCINATIONS):**\n- Adding letters not in original AND not keyboard-adjacent: Pyrex \u2192 Pyrexx \u274c (extra 'x' not justified)\n- Multiple simultaneous edits: Pyrex \u2192 Prx \u274c (two letters removed)\n- Inventing new letter combinations: Bellroy \u2192 Bellrizza \u274c\n- Any output not derivable from brand_name input\n\n**VALIDATION: Before outputting each typo, ask: \""Can I explain this typo with ONE edit rule?\""**\n- If YES \u2192 Keep it\n- If NO \u2192 It's a hallucination \u2192 REMOVE IT\n\n### Step 3: Validate Each Entity (Amazon Test)\nBefore adding to output, check: \""Can I buy [last word] on Amazon?\""\n- If YES \u2192 REMOVE (it's a product word)\n- If NO \u2192 KEEP (it's a brand)\n\n**EXCLUDE:**\n- Any word that passes the Amazon test (products you can buy)\n- Features (wireless, waterproof, slim, RFID)\n- Any [Brand] + [product noun] combination\n\n## Validation Process (MANDATORY)\n\n**For EACH candidate entity, do this check BEFORE adding to output:**\n\n### Step 1: Split entity into words\n`Bose Deep Bass` \u2192 [\""Bose\"", \""Deep\"", \""Bass\""]\n\n### Step 2: Check the LAST word\nAsk: \""Is [last word] something I can buy, use, or a feature?\""\n\n### Step 3: Decide\n- **If last word is a product/feature** \u2192 REMOVE entire entity\n- **If last word is only the brand name or typo** \u2192 KEEP\n\n### Common product words (things you can buy/use):\ntoys, figure, earbuds, speaker, bass, sound, bottle, wallet, holder, bag, case, organizer, kitchen, bread\n\n### Common features (describe the product):\nwireless, waterproof, deep, slim, RFID, insulated, stainless\n\n### Examples of the Amazon Test in Action\n\n| Entity | Last Word | Amazon Test | Result |\n|--------|-----------|-------------|--------|\n| `Bellroy Wallet` | wallet | Can buy wallets \u2713 | REMOVE |\n| `Transformers Toys` | toys | Can buy toys \u2713 | REMOVE |\n| `Bose Earbuds` | earbuds | Can buy earbuds \u2713 | REMOVE |\n| `Pyrex Kitchen` | kitchen | Can buy kitchen items \u2713 | REMOVE |\n| `Zojirushi Bread` | bread | Can buy bread \u2713 | REMOVE |\n| `Bose Deep Bass` | bass | \""bass\"" is audio feature | REMOVE |\n| `Bellroy` | Bellroy | Can't buy \""Bellroy\"" alone | KEEP |\n| `PowerIQ` | PowerIQ | Trademarked name | KEEP |\n| `ColorStay` | ColorStay | Trademarked name | KEEP |\n\n## Output Format\n\nOutput validated brand entities with typos (max 10):\n\n```json\n{\""brand_entities\"": [\""Brand\"", \""brand\"", \""Brnad\"", \""Bradn\"", \""Brandd\"", \""SubBrand\"", ...]}\n```\n\n**CRITICAL: Each entity must be UNIQUE - no duplicates allowed!**\n\n**Expected output structure:**\n- Original brand name + 3-5 typos (all unique)\n- Lowercase variation (exactly 1)\n- Sub-brand if exists + its typos\n- Manufacturer if different from brand + its typos\n\n### Complete Example\n\n**Input:**\n- brand_name: \""Anker\""\n- manufacturer: \""Belkin\""\n- title: \""Anker PowerIQ Fast Charging USB Wall Charger...\""\n\n**Expected Output:**\n```json\n{\n  \""brand_entities\"": [\n    \""Anker\"",\n    \""anker\"",\n    \""Ankr\"",\n    \""Akner\"",\n    \""Annker\"",\n    \""PowerIQ\"",\n    \""poweriq\"",\n    \""PwerIQ\"",\n    \""Belkin\"",\n    \""belkin\""\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n**Why these entities:**\n- `Anker` + 4 typos (lowercase, missing letter, swap, doubled)\n- `PowerIQ` + 2 typos (trademarked sub-brand)\n- `Belkin` + 1 typo (manufacturer, different from brand)\n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\udd34 THINK OF YOUR OUTPUT AS A SET\n\n**Mathematical set = NO DUPLICATES ALLOWED**\n\nYour output array is a **SET**, not a list.

"[{""content"": ""# Task: ExtractOwnBrandEntities\n\nYou are an Amazon PPC specialist extracting brand entities from product listings.\n\n## Core Concept: Brand Entity vs Product Word\n\n**Brand Entity** = WHO makes this? (trademark, company name)\n**Product Word** = WHAT is this? (thing you can buy)\n\n### The Amazon Test\n\nFor each word, ask: **\""Can I search Amazon and buy a [word] as a standalone product?\""**\n\n- \""wallet\"" \u2192 Yes, you can buy a wallet \u2192 **PRODUCT WORD** \u2192 exclude\n- \""bottle\"" \u2192 Yes, you can buy a bottle \u2192 **PRODUCT WORD** \u2192 exclude\n- \""kitchen\"" \u2192 Yes, you can buy kitchen items \u2192 **PRODUCT WORD** \u2192 exclude\n- \""bread\"" \u2192 Yes, you can buy bread \u2192 **PRODUCT WORD** \u2192 exclude\n- \""Anker\"" \u2192 No, Anker is a brand name \u2192 **BRAND ENTITY** \u2192 include\n- \""PowerIQ\"" \u2192 No, it's a trademarked product line \u2192 **BRAND ENTITY** \u2192 include\n\n### \ud83d\udd34 CRITICAL: Apply Amazon Test to EVERY word in multi-word entities\n\nWhen you have a sub-brand like \""[Brand] [SubBrand]\"", you MUST test EACH word:\n\n1. Test \""[SubBrand]\"" alone: Can you buy a \""[SubBrand]\"" on Amazon?\n   - If \""[SubBrand]\"" is a common word \u2192 **REMOVE the entire entity**\n   - If \""[SubBrand]\"" is ONLY used as this brand's trademark \u2192 **KEEP**\n\n**Common words that FAIL the Amazon Test when used in sub-brands:**\n- beam, wave, pro, max, plus, ultra \u2192 generic product modifiers\n- bass, sound, audio, noise \u2192 audio/electronics terms\n- fresh, pure, clean, clear \u2192 descriptive adjectives\n- sport, active, fit, flex \u2192 lifestyle terms\n\n**Rule: If the last word of a sub-brand is a dictionary word with meaning outside this brand, EXCLUDE the entire sub-brand entity.**\n\n**Examples:**\n| Sub-brand | Last Word Test | Decision |\n|-----------|---------------|----------|\n| `Bose Deep Bass` | \""bass\"" = audio term | \u274c REMOVE |\n| `Bose Sound Pro` | \""pro\"" = generic modifier | \u274c REMOVE |\n| `Anker PowerIQ` | \""PowerIQ\"" = unique trademark | \u2705 KEEP |\n| `ColorStay` | unique trademark | \u2705 KEEP |\n\n### \ud83d\udeab DO NOT Extract Partial Sub-Brands\n\n**When a multi-word sub-brand fails the Amazon Test, skip the ENTIRE concept:**\n\n\u274c **WRONG approach:**\n1. See \""Sound Pro\"" in title\n2. Test \u2192 \""pro\"" is generic \u2192 reject \""Sound Pro\""\n3. Think \""maybe Sound alone is valid\"" \u2192 extract \""Sound\"" \u2190 **WRONG!**\n\n\u2705 **CORRECT approach:**\n1. See \""Sound Pro\"" in title\n2. Test \u2192 \""pro\"" is generic \u2192 reject ENTIRE \""Sound Pro\"" concept\n3. Do NOT extract \""Sound\"" separately\n4. Only extract the main brand (e.g., \""Bose\"")\n\n**Why?** If \""Word1 Word2\"" was meant as a product line name, extracting just \""Word1\"" loses the trademark context. \""Sound\"" alone is generic and meaningless without \""Pro\"".\n\n### Critical Rule\n\n**If your entity is [Brand] + [Product Word], ONLY keep the brand part.**\n\nExamples:\n- `Bellroy Wallet` \u2192 \""wallet\"" passes Amazon test \u2192 keep only `Bellroy`\n- `Pyrex Kitchen` \u2192 \""kitchen\"" passes Amazon test \u2192 keep only `Pyrex`\n- `PowerIQ Charger` \u2192 \""charger\"" passes Amazon test \u2192 keep only `PowerIQ`\n\n## Inputs\n\n- **brand_name**: RoadNow\n- **title**: RoadNow 700191 HVAC Blower Motor Fits for Cadillac Escalade EXT 2003-2006,for Chevy Avalanche 1500 2500,for Silverado 1500 2500 3500,for GMC Sierra 1500 2500 3500 Replacement Part 89019320 88986838\n- **bullet_points**: \ud835\udc01\ud835\udc25\ud835\udc28\ud835\udc30\ud835\udc1e\ud835\udc2b \ud835\udc0c\ud835\udc28\ud835\udc2d\ud835\udc28\ud835\udc2b \ud835\udc02\ud835\udc28\ud835\udc26\ud835\udc29\ud835\udc1a\ud835\udc2d\ud835\udc22\ud835\udc1b\ud835\udc22\ud835\udc25\ud835\udc22\ud835\udc2d\ud835\udc32: RoadNow Blower replacement compatible with Cadillac Escalade EXT 2003-2006 | for Avalanche 1500 & 2500 2003-2006 | for Silverado 1500 & 2500 & 3500 2003-2006 | for Silverado 1500HD & 2500HD 2003-2006 | for GMC Sierra 1500 & 3500 2003-2006 | for GMC Sierra 2500 2007 | for GMC Sierra 1500HD 2003 2007 | for GMC Sierra 2500HD 2003-2006 | for Hummer H2 2003-2007.\n\ud835\udc01\ud835\udc1e\ud835\udc32\ud835\udc28\ud835\udc27\ud835\udc1d \ud835\udc04\ud835\udc31\ud835\udc1c\ud835\udc1e\ud835\udc25\ud835\udc25\ud835\udc1e\ud835\udc27\ud835\udc2d \ud835\udc10\ud835\udc2e\ud835\udc1a\ud835\udc25\ud835\udc22\ud835\udc2d\ud835\udc32: Dynamic-balanced design and sealed bearings push high CFM without the racket of high speed fans for cooling.
