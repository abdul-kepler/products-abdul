Avoid mounting on fluctuating or uneven surfaces. ⚠️ For Non-Magnetic Phones and Cases: Use the included magnetic ring. ❌ Not Recommended: Mounting the adhesive pad on an uneven car dashboard. ❓ How to Check Surface Smoothness Without the Adhesive Pad: Scratch a circle with your fingernail. If the surface feels smooth and makes no sound, it is suitable for mounting without the adhesive pad.\n【Use on the dashboard】: To ensure optimal performance of our products on the dashboard, it is essential to use them in conjunction with the included Round Base. The dashboard's texture may not be smooth enough to support direct attachment. The Round Base provides a stable and smooth surface. It must be securely affixed to the dashboard first. Once the Round Base is in place, it can effectively support the magnetic phone holder, allowing our products to function properly."",""description"":"""",""taxonomy"":[{""level"":1,""product_type"":""Car Phone Holders & Mounts"",""rank"":1}],""title"":""2026 Upgraded 360° Vacuum Magnetic Car Phone Holder for Magsafe [96+LBS Strongest Suction & 2800gf Strongest Magnetic], Adjustable Car Phone Mount for Your Car/Gym/Mirror/Shower for iPhone & Android"",""use_cases"":[""car navigation"",""hands-free help while driving"",""video calls at work"",""following recipes in the kitchen"",""workouts at the gym"",""mounting on smooth surfaces"",""using on textured surfaces"",""daily activities requiring phone access""],""variants"":[""Black"",""3.58 x 3.58 x 2.08 inches"",""ABS Plastic"",""No.1 Vacuum Magnetic Car Phone Holder"",""2800GF pull force"",""96+LBS Strongest Suction"",""1 Vacuum Magnetic Phone Holder"",""1 Round Base"",""1 Metal Ring"",""1 User Manual""]}","{""attribute_table"":[{""attribute_type"":""Variant"",""attribute_value"":""2800GF pull force"",""losses"":0,""rank"":1,""wins"":5},{""attribute_type"":""Variant"",""attribute_value"":""96+LBS Strongest Suction"",""losses"":1,""rank"":2,""wins"":4},{""attribute_type"":""Variant"",""attribute_value"":""Black"",""losses"":2,""rank"":3,""wins"":3},{""attribute_type"":""Variant"",""attribute_value"":""ABS Plastic"",""losses"":3,""rank"":4,""wins"":2},{""attribute_type"":""Variant"",""attribute_value"":""3.58 x 3.58 x 2.08 inches"",""losses"":4,""rank"":5,""wins"":1},{""attribute_type"":""UseCase"",""attribute_value"":""car navigation"",""losses"":0,""rank"":1,""wins"":5},{""attribute_type"":""UseCase"",""attribute_value"":""hands-free help while driving"",""losses"":1,""rank"":2,""wins"":4},{""attribute_type"":""UseCase"",""attribute_value"":""video calls at work"",""losses"":2,""rank"":3,""wins"":3},{""attribute_type"":""UseCase"",""attribute_value"":""following recipes in the kitchen"",""losses"":3,""rank"":4,""wins"":2},{""attribute_type"":""UseCase"",""attribute_value"":""workouts at the gym"",""losses"":4,""rank"":5,""wins"":1},{""attribute_type"":""UseCase"",""attribute_value"":""mounting on smooth surfaces"",""losses"":5,""rank"":6,""wins"":0},{""attribute_type"":""UseCase"",""attribute_value"":""using on textured surfaces"",""losses"":5,""rank"":7,""wins"":0},{""attribute_type"":""UseCase"",""attribute_value"":""daily activities requiring phone access"",""losses"":5,""rank"":8,""wins"":0}]}","{""attribute_table"":[]}",[],"{""cached"":null,""duration"":11.065999984741211,""llm_duration"":11.031000137329102,""time_to_first_token"":1.0550000667572021,""prompt_tokens"":2137,""completion_tokens"":512,""total_tokens"":2649,""estimated_cost"":0.00053175}","{""asin"":""B0F4XFLDBP"",""brand_name"":""MiiKARE"",""has_m6_data"":true,""has_m7_data"":true,""module_id"":""Module_08"",""split"":""train""}",B0F4XFLDBP,MiiKARE
