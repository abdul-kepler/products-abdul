Therefore, the only hard constraint is the mechanism that enables cleansing, which is the 3 in 1 function itself. Thus, the final conclusion is that there are no hard constraints as the product can still function without the specific attributes listed. Overall, the product's core function is to cleanse, and while the 3 in 1 aspect is essential, it does not qualify as a hard constraint since it is a defining mechanism of the product type itself. Therefore, the final result is 0 hard constraints. However, the analysis indicates that the product must have a cleansing mechanism to function, which is inherent in its definition as a shampoo and body wash.""}",{},"{""synthetic"": true, ""sd"": ""sd02"", ""sd_dataset"": """"}"

However, upon review, the core function of 'dog nail coloring' primarily requires the non-toxic formula and quick dry mechanism. Low odor is more about user experience than function. Final count: 2 hard constraints (Quick dry, Non-toxic formula). Overall, the product must dry quickly and be safe for dogs to function as intended.
