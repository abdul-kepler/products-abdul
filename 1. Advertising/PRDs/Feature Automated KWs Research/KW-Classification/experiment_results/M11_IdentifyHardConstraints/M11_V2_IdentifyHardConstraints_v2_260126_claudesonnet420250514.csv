3. 15"" x 10"" Size: Step 1 - Remove this size? Smaller/larger trays still serve food. Step 2 - SIZE specification, not mechanism. Step 3 - Basic trays come in various sizes. NOT a hard constraint.

4. Lightweight: Step 1 - Remove lightweight property? Heavy trays still serve food. Step 2 - QUALITY marker (NEVER category). Step 3 - Basic trays can be heavy. NOT a hard constraint.

5. Ergonomic Handles: Step 1 - Remove handles? Flat trays without handles still serve food (just harder to carry). Step 2 - CONVENIENCE feature, not core mechanism. Step 3 - Basic trays often lack handles. NOT a hard constraint.

6. Raised Edges: Step 1 - Remove raised edges? Flat trays still serve food (items might slide off but tray still functions). Step 2 - DESIGN feature for containment, not core mechanism. Step 3 - Basic trays can be completely flat. NOT a hard constraint.

The core function 'serving food and drinks' can be performed by a basic flat piece of any material - plastic, wood, metal. All attributes here are QUALITY modifiers, MATERIAL choices, or CONVENIENCE features that improve the experience but aren't required for the basic function. A $1 plastic cafeteria tray performs the same core function.

Conclusion: 0 hard constraints."
