It contains only the highest quality ingredients including fish, plankton, squid, and shrimp. As with all of the Seachem NutriDiets, Marine Plus Flakes have Chlorella Algae as an exceptional source of a broad range of vitamins, amino acids as well as all other nutrients required for animal life. Chlorella Algae is considered a potential super food that far surpasses the nutrients delivered by Spirulina Algae common to other diets. It is enhanced with Entice™ to attract finicky eaters and enhance palatability. Additionally, Marine Plus Flakes contain GarlicGuard™ as an appetite stimulant. The high levels of Vitamin C in the diet are especially important for the health of marine fish. Vitamin C is a cofactor in the processes necessary for the formation of connective tissue, scar tissue in wound repair, and bone matrix. This is a difficult vitamin for fish to acquire in their natural diet, but is critical in addressing healing and growth issues. Marine Plus Flakes also contain proteinates and hydrolysates which allow for more rapid and simplistic digestion of the partner nutrients. Less energy is required by the fish to digest the food. The food is more completely digested which reduces unnecessary waste in the system and better overall health of the fish. This also allows for more nutrient uptake and increased immune function.
