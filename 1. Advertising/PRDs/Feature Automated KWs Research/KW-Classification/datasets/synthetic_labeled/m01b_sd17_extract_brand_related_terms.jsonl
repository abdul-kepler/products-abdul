Raicer published his first design in the late lamented Command Magazine, 1918: Storm in the West, covering the last nine months of WWI on the Western Front. The game was an immediate success, earning a Charles S. Roberts Award nomination, and leading to the design of a Plan 1919 variant which assumed a German defensive strategy in 1918 and an all-out Allied assault to win the war the following year. GMT is pleased to offer a new boxed version of these classic Great War designs, with new artwork, and including an additional 1918 Allied Offensive scenario published later in Command.\n\nThis new GMT boxed version of 1918/19: Storm in the West is a two-player system that also works fine for solo play. Units are mostly corps (divisions for the USA, whose oversized units were nearly the size of Allied corps), and include infantry, tanks, cavalry and air support. The Germans start the 1918 campaign with large numbers of Stosstruppen, trained to overcome the trench stalemate of the previous three years. This gives the German player a strong offensive capability in the first half of the game. But these “shock troops” are a wasting asset, and if the Allies survive the initial blows, growing numbers of US troops and Allied tanks will see the Germans forced into a desperate defense in the game's second half.\n\nIn the Plan 1919 campaign, the Germans are assumed to have used the collapse of Russia to stabilize the Balkan and Italian fronts, forgoing the historical 1918 Kaiser's Battles in the West. The Allies are thus faced with a strong German defense, but with a fully mobilized American army and backed by masses of tanks and planes. This hypothetical campaign challenges the Allies to leverage these arms into the world's first blitzkrieg, while the Germans fight to force a stalemate that will leave them dominant in Europe.\n\nThe large-hex map, scaled at 8 miles to the hex, covers the active area of the Western Front, from Epinal in the", "manufacturer": "GMT Games"}, "expected": {"sub_brands": [], "searchable_standards": [], "manufacturer": null}, "metadata": {"module_id": "Module_01b", "asin": "B08NWZ6VV2", "brand_name": "GMT Games", "product_type": "BOARD_GAME", "source": "keepa", "sd_dataset": "sd17"}}

Each side of these five blocks plays a different phrase of music, chosen from three musical themes. This variety of phrasings allows children to compose many different sound combinations and patterns. As they enjoy their time creating, children develop lifelong cognitive skills. Music Blocks At a Glance: Five multicolored blocks for children to play their own musical creations Each side of each block plays a different phrase Three musical styles: Jumpin' Jive Jazz, African Rhythms, and Mozart's Night Music Musical patterns positively affect the way your child's brain develops Lay the groundwork for a lifetime of learning and creativity Age/Weight Requirements:\nTwo years and up Assembly Requirements:\nFour AA batteries Five multi-colored blocks play eclectic musical phrases.

Create Unique Melodies with Five Multicolored Blocks\nNeurosmith Music Blocks feature five multicolored blocks for children to play with and use to shape their own musical creations. The blocks fit into their display in a row and are held securely in place with magnets. When children press down on the blocks, each block will play a phrase of music. Each side of each block plays a different phrase, and children are encouraged to turn the blocks both to hear different phrasings and to see the different visual shapes on every side. Play Phrasings in Three Different Styles\nOnce they've decided which musical phrasing they like for each block, children can press the red button on the front of the display, and the blocks will play one after another from left to right to showcase the new composition. Children can follow along as each block lights up while it plays, and rearrange for new creations.\nIn addition, a switch on the back of the display allows children to play the blocks in three different musical styles: Jumpin' Jive Jazz, African Rhythms, and Mozart's Night Music. These styles provide a range of rhythms and melodies to inspire a child's creativity. Develop Play Patterns to Shape Cognitive Development\nAs children arrange and rearrange the blocks to make compositions, they develop a series of playtime actions called \"play patterns.\" Research indicates that these patterns can positively affect the way your child's brain develops by stimulating and developing important connections through sound and visuals. By encouraging these connections, Neurosmith Music Blocks lay the groundwork for a lifetime of learning and creativity. What's in the Box\nNeurosmith Music Blocks and instructions for use.\n\nProduct Description\n\n\"When it comes to \"building\" musical creativity, nothing tops Neurosmith's Music Blocks!
