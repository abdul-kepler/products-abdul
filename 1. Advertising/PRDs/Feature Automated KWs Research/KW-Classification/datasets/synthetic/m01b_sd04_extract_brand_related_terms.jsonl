GABA is a neurotransmitter within our brains that can help make it easier to fall asleep by eliminating the excess “chatter” in our minds. Glutathione is an antioxidant the body naturally produces that can help improve our ability to relax. Together, these three components may help stave off occasional sleeplessness.\nMAXIMUM ABSORPTION LIPOSOMAL TECHNOLOGY: Unlike traditional pills and liquids, where the active ingredients get destroyed by acids in the digestive tract, Core Med Science uses Liposomal Technology to protect nutrients with a liposomal “bubble” to safely deliver nutrients into the bloodstream for optimal absorption. Provides up to 80% more absorption and is also gentler on your stomach.\nTRUSTED INGREDIENTS, MADE IN THE USA: We source only ingredients of the highest quality to develop our vitamins and supplements. Unlike most supplement manufacturers, our products are China-free and proudly made from start to finish in the USA in a cGMP facility. All are non-GMO and alcohol, shellfish, wheat, dairy, egg, tree nut, soy, fish, and peanut free. If you’re not satisfied with our product, contact us within 90 days and we'll be happy to help.\nOUR STORY: Dr. Bogdan Popa founded “IV for Life”, an IV nutritional therapy clinic in Orange County, California. The “liposomal” method of oral nutrient delivery provides a perfect high absorption conduit to deliver the same nutrients orally as those used in IV. Dr. Popa created “Core Med Science” to provide oral liposomal supplements with nutrients “matching” the ingredients of the most common and popular IV infusions such as Glutathione and Vitamin C.", "description": "", "manufacturer": "Core Med Science"}, "expected": {"sub_brands": [], "searchable_standards": [], "manufacturer": null}, "metadata": {"module_id": "Module_01b", "asin": "B084VHNSLG", "brand_name": "Core Med Science", "product_type": "MEDICATION", "source": "keepa", "sd_dataset": "sd04"}}
