Raicer published his first design in the late lamented Command Magazine, 1918: Storm in the West, covering the last nine months of WWI on the Western Front. The game was an immediate success, earning a Charles S. Roberts Award nomination, and leading to the design of a Plan 1919 variant which assumed a German defensive strategy in 1918 and an all-out Allied assault to win the war the following year. GMT is pleased to offer a new boxed version of these classic Great War designs, with new artwork, and including an additional 1918 Allied Offensive scenario published later in Command.\n\nThis new GMT boxed version of 1918/19: Storm in the West is a two-player system that also works fine for solo play. Units are mostly corps (divisions for the USA, whose oversized units were nearly the size of Allied corps), and include infantry, tanks, cavalry and air support. The Germans start the 1918 campaign with large numbers of Stosstruppen, trained to overcome the trench stalemate of the previous three years. This gives the German player a strong offensive capability in the first half of the game. But these “shock troops” are a wasting asset, and if the Allies survive the initial blows, growing numbers of US troops and Allied tanks will see the Germans forced into a desperate defense in the game's second half.\n\nIn the Plan 1919 campaign, the Germans are assumed to have used the collapse of Russia to stabilize the Balkan and Italian fronts, forgoing the historical 1918 Kaiser's Battles in the West. The Allies are thus faced with a strong German defense, but with a fully mobilized American army and backed by masses of tanks and planes. This hypothetical campaign challenges the Allies to leverage these arms into the world's first blitzkrieg, while the Germans fight to force a stalemate that will leave them dominant in Europe.\n\nThe large-hex map, scaled at 8 miles to the hex, covers the active area of the Western Front, from Epinal in the", "taxonomy": [{"level": 1, "product_type": "Board Game", "rank": 1}, {"level": 2, "product_type": "Tabletop Game", "rank": 2}, {"level": 3, "product_type": "Games", "rank": 3}], "attribute_table": [{"attribute_type": "Variant", "attribute_value": "Black", "rank": 1}, {"attribute_type": "Variant", "attribute_value": "Two-player system", "rank": 2}, {"attribute_type": "Variant", "attribute_value": "Large-hex map scaled at 8 miles to the hex", "rank": 3}, {"attribute_type": "Variant", "attribute_value": "Includes infantry, tanks, cavalry, and air support", "rank": 4}, {"attribute_type": "Variant", "attribute_value": "1918 Allied Offensive scenario", "rank": 5}, {"attribute_type": "Variant", "attribute_value": "Plan 1919 variant", "rank": 6}, {"attribute_type": "Use Case", "attribute_value": "Two-player board game for strategic gameplay", "rank": 1}, {"attribute_type": "Use Case", "attribute_value": "Solo play option for individual gamers", "rank": 2}, {"attribute_type": "Use Case", "attribute_value": "Historical simulation of World War I battles", "rank": 3}, {"attribute_type": "Use Case", "attribute_value": "Engaging in tactical warfare on the Western Front", "rank": 4}, {"attribute_type": "Use Case", "attribute_value": "Exploring hypothetical military strategies in the Plan 1919 campaign", "rank": 5}, {"attribute_type": "Audience", "attribute_value": "Board game enthusiasts", "rank": 1}, {"attribute_type": "Audience", "attribute_value": "History buffs interested in World War I", "rank": 2}, {"attribute_type": "Audience", "attribute_value": "Gamers looking for strategic and tactical challenges", "rank": 3}, {"attribute_type": "Audience", "attribute_value": "Fans of GMT Games", "rank": 4}], "product_attributes": {"variants": ["Black", "Two-player system", "Large-hex map scaled at 8 miles to the hex", "Includes infantry, tanks, cavalry, and air support", "1918 Allied Offensive scenario", "Plan 1919 variant"], "use_cases": ["Two-player board game for strategic gameplay", "Solo play option for individual gamers", "Historical simulation of World War I battles", "Engaging in tactical warfare on the Western Front", "Exploring hypothetical military strategies in the Plan 1919 campaign"], "audiences": ["Board game enthusiasts", "History buffs interested in World War I", "Gamers looking for strategic and tactical challenges", "Fans of GMT Games"]}}, "expected": {"validated_use": ""}, "metadata": {"module_id": "Module_10", "asin": "B08NWZ6VV2", "sd_dataset": "sd17", "source": "synthetic_from_m06_m07_m08_m09"}}

Each side of each block plays a different phrase, and children are encouraged to turn the blocks both to hear different phrasings and to see the different visual shapes on every side. Play Phrasings in Three Different Styles\nOnce they've decided which musical phrasing they like for each block, children can press the red button on the front of the display, and the blocks will play one after another from left to right to showcase the new composition. Children can follow along as each block lights up while it plays, and rearrange for new creations.\nIn addition, a switch on the back of the display allows children to play the blocks in three different musical styles: Jumpin' Jive Jazz, African Rhythms, and Mozart's Night Music. These styles provide a range of rhythms and melodies to inspire a child's creativity. Develop Play Patterns to Shape Cognitive Development\nAs children arrange and rearrange the blocks to make compositions, they develop a series of playtime actions called \"play patterns.\" Research indicates that these patterns can positively affect the way your child's brain develops by stimulating and developing important connections through sound and visuals. By encouraging these connections, Neurosmith Music Blocks lay the groundwork for a lifetime of learning and creativity.
