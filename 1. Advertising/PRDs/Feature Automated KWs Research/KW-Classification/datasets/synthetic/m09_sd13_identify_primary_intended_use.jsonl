A1: Our alternators are brand-new and undergo 1OO% testing. If you receive an alternator that is not working or charging, here are the reasons: ①Problems with the protector, relay, contactor and other equipment may cause the alternator to fail to operate normally. ②Cooling system failure may cause the alternator to overheat and fail to operate. ③The oil circuit is blocked due to poor quality of the engine oil or long-term failure to change the oil. ④Problems with the in-take & ex-haust systems may cause the alternator to fail to operate normally. ⑤The battery goes dead. Q2: Why is a car battery not charging with a new alternator? A2: ①Faulty wiring: There may be an issue with the wiring that connects the alternator to the battery. This could be anything from a loose connection to a damaged wire .②Battery issues: The problem may not lie with the alternator, but with the battery itself. If the battery is old or damaged, it may not be able to hold a charge, even if the alternator is functioning properly. ③Voltage regulator problems: The voltage regulator controls the amount of voltage supplied to the battery by the alternator. If the voltage regulator is faulty, it may not allow the proper charge to be delivered to the battery. ④Parasitic drain: There could be a parasitic drain on the battery, meaning that some electrical component or system in the car is drawing power even when the car is turned off. This can prevent the battery from charging properly, even with a new alternator. ⑤The alternator is not being spun adequately (belt is slipping).⑥.

Premium base stocks are blended with a modern ashless detergent additive package to provide fortification for maximum performance in outboard engines. It is pre-diluted for ease of mixing with gasoline and may also be used in direct fuel injection systems. This product is recommended for all leading outboard engines, including the latest high horsepower units direct fuel injection models. Valvoline Outboard 2-Cycle Marine Engine Oil will also provide excellent performance in twocycle engines of motorcycles, all-terrain vehicles, snowmobiles and personal watercrafts. It may be used at manufacturers recommended fuel/oil ratios from 11:1 to 100:1\n\nAmazon.com\n\nMotor oil is made from crude oil and is used to lubricate, clean, and cool engines. Types of motor oil include conventional, synthetic, diesel, bio-based, hybrid (blends of conventional and synthetic), and recycled oils. Motor oil varies in weight and viscosity, as well as additives that some manufacturers add to the oil during the refining process. A numerical code system created by the Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) grades motor oils according to viscosity--the higher the number between 0 and 60, the more viscous (thicker) the oil is. Most consumer motor oils are graded by two numbers, with the first number indicating cold weather (Winter or \"W\") performance. 2-Stroke Engine Oil\nThis oil is specifically designed for 2-stroke (or 2-cycle) engines. 2-stroke engines are typically \"total-loss lubrication\" engines, meaning that this oil will burn up in the combustion chamber when the engine is on and will need to be replaced regularly. Common uses of 2-stroke oil are some motorcycles, lawnmowers, snowmobiles, marine outboard motors, and other small-engine devices. Conventional Motor Oil\nThis oil is a conventional motor oil, meaning it is refined from crude oil or petroleum products. Conventional motor oils may or may not have additives included after refining. Conventional motor oils are more versatile than synthetic or hybrid motor oils, because they are suitable for use with nearly all types of modern vehicle engines, from cars and trucks to motorcycles, ATVs, farm equipment, and more.", "taxonomy": [{"level": 1, "product_type": "2-Stroke Engine Oil", "rank": 1}, {"level": 2, "product_type": "Motor Oil", "rank": 2}, {"level": 3, "product_type": "Automotive Oil", "rank": 3}], "attribute_table": [{"attribute_type": "Variant", "attribute_value": "16 Ounce", "rank": 1}, {"attribute_type": "Variant", "attribute_value": "Case of 12", "rank": 2}, {"attribute_type": "Variant", "attribute_value": "NMMA certified ashless two-cycle lubricant", "rank": 3}, {"attribute_type": "Variant", "attribute_value": "Pre-diluted for ease of mixing with gasoline", "rank": 4}, {"attribute_type": "Variant", "attribute_value": "Acceptable for outboards with Direct Fuel Injection (DFI) systems", "rank": 5}, {"attribute_type": "Variant", "attribute_value": "Recommended fuel/oil ratios from 11:1 to 100:1", "rank": 6}, {"attribute_type": "Use Case", "attribute_value": "Lubricating and protecting outboard marine engines", "rank": 1}, {"attribute_type": "Use Case", "attribute_value": "Improving engine life through enhanced deposit protection", "rank": 2}, {"attribute_type": "Use Case", "attribute_value": "Controlling combustion and exhaust system deposits", "rank": 3}, {"attribute_type": "Use Case", "attribute_value": "Maintaining torque and acceleration in marine applications", "rank": 4}, {"attribute_type": "Use Case", "attribute_value": "Providing excellent performance in two-cycle engines of motorcycles, all-terrain vehicles, snowmobiles, and personal watercrafts", "rank": 5}, {"attribute_type": "Audience", "attribute_value": "Boat owners", "rank": 1}, {"attribute_type": "Audience", "attribute_value": "Marine engine users", "rank": 2}, {"attribute_type": "Audience", "attribute_value": "Motorcycle and ATV enthusiasts", "rank": 3}, {"attribute_type": "Audience", "attribute_value": "Snowmobile users", "rank": 4}, {"attribute_type": "Audience", "attribute_value": "Personal watercraft owners", "rank": 5}], "product_attributes": {"variants": ["16 Ounce", "Case of 12", "NMMA certified ashless two-cycle lubricant", "Pre-diluted for ease of mixing with gasoline", "Acceptable for outboards with Direct Fuel Injection (DFI) systems", "Recommended fuel/oil ratios from 11:1 to 100:1"], "use_cases": ["Lubricating and protecting outboard marine engines", "Improving engine life through enhanced deposit protection", "Controlling combustion and exhaust system deposits", "Maintaining torque and acceleration in marine applications", "Providing excellent performance in two-cycle engines of motorcycles, all-terrain vehicles, snowmobiles, and personal watercrafts"], "audiences": ["Boat owners", "Marine engine users", "Motorcycle and ATV enthusiasts", "Snowmobile users", "Personal watercraft owners"]}}, "expected": {"primary_use": ""}, "metadata": {"module_id": "Module_09", "asin": "B001B14OFO", "sd_dataset": "sd13", "source": "synthetic_from_m06_m07_m08"}}
