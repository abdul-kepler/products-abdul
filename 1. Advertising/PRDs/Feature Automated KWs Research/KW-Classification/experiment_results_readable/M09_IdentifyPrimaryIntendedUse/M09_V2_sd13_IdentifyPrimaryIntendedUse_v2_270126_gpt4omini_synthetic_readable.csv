IMPORTANT NOTICE BEFORE INSTALLATION: ①Please verify your vehicle make, model, year, engine, and OEM part number before installation. Contact-us if you're unsure about compatibility. ② Flush the entire power steering system thoroughly before installing the new pump. Contaminated fluid can lead to premature failure. ③ Always replace old O-rings and seals on both high-pressure and return hoses. Reusing worn seals can cause external leaks. ④ Use only the manufacturer-recommended power steering fluid. Mixing fluid types can damage the system. ⑤ Do not overtighten mounting bolts. Excessive torque can crack the pump housing. ⑥ Bleed air from the system by turning the steering wheel fully left and right several times before starting the engine, then repeat after startup. ⑦ Professional installation is strongly recommended. Improper installation may lead to noise, leaks, or loss of power assist.
Signs of a faulty power steering pump(aka: ""power assit pump"" or ""vane pump"") include: ① steering fluid leaks ② squealing noise when steering ③ heavy and jerky steering ④ metal flakes in the fluid ⑤ power steering symbol on dashboard
Precautions for installation: About Noisy: Check whether the resistance of the suction pipe is too high. Check whether the pressure adjustment of the safety valve is too high. The gas in the pump must be evacuated, check the tightness of each joint, prevent air from entering. About Leaking: Check whether the pipes and pipe joints are damaged. Tighten the fixing screws of the booster pump. Check, clean or replace the filter device, keep the oil circuit unblocked, and avoid the valve core being blocked by foreign matter.
How to install the power steering pump: 1. Ensure the vehicle is stationary and disconnect the negative terminal of the battery. 2. Locate the original power steering pump, typically located near the front of the engine, close to the crankshaft and steering system. 3. Using the appropriate tools, loosen and remove the belt from the original power steering pump, making a note of the belt's routing for future installation. 4. Unbolt or remove the fastening screws of the original power steering pump and take it off the vehicle. 5. Align the new power steering pump with the corresponding bracket or base on the vehicle and secure it in place using bolts or fastening screws. 6. Install the belt correctly on the new power steering pump, following the routing recorded from the original pump. 7. Ensure the belt is properly tensioned. 8. Check the tightness o",confidence,0.9

【Important Tips】Farrme car alternators are brand-new and undergo 1OO% testing. When checking your alternator output do not check it at negative, you check it at pos (B+) terminal. Q1: Why did my brand-new alternator stop working? A1: Our alternators are brand-new and undergo 1OO% testing. If you receive an alternator that is not working or charging, here are the reasons: ①Problems with the protector, relay, contactor and other equipment may cause the alternator to fail to operate normally. ②Cooling system failure may cause the alternator to overheat and fail to operate. ③The oil circuit is blocked due to poor quality of the engine oil or long-term failure to change the oil. ④Problems with the in-take & ex-haust systems may cause the alternator to fail to operate normally. ⑤The battery goes dead. Q2: Why is a car battery not charging with a new alternator? A2: ①Faulty wiring: There may be an issue with the wiring that connects the alternator to the battery. This could be anything from a loose connection to a damaged wire .②Battery issues: The problem may not lie with the alternator, but with the battery itself. If the battery is old or damaged, it may not be able to hold a charge, even if the alternator is functioning properly. ③Voltage regulator problems: The voltage regulator controls the amount of voltage supplied to the battery by the alternator. If the voltage regulator is faulty, it may not allow the proper charge to be delivered to the battery. ④Parasitic drain: There could be a parasitic drain on the battery, meaning that some electrical component or system in the car is drawing power even when the car is turned off. This can prevent the battery from charging",confidence,0.9

Valvoline Outboard 2-Cycle Marine Engine Oil is a superior quality NMMA certified ashless two-cycle lubricant. Premium base stocks are blended with a modern ashless detergent additive package to provide fortification for maximum performance in outboard engines. It is pre-diluted for ease of mixing with gasoline and may also be used in direct fuel injection systems.

Valvoline Outboard 2-Cycle Marine Engine Oil will also provide excellent performance in twocycle engines of motorcycles, all-terrain vehicles, snowmobiles and personal watercrafts. It may be used at manufacturers recommended fuel/oil ratios from 11:1 to 100:1

Amazon.com

Motor oil is made from crude oil and is used to lubricate, clean, and cool engines. Types of motor oil include conventional, synthetic, diesel, bio-based, hybrid (blends of conventional and synthetic), and recycled oils. Motor oil varies in weight and viscosity, as well as additives that some manufacturers add to the oil during the refining process. A numerical code system created by the Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) grades motor oils according to viscosity--the higher the number between 0 and 60, the more viscous (thicker) the oil is. Most consumer motor oils are graded by two numbers, with the first number indicating cold weather (Winter or ""W"") performance. 2-Stroke Engine Oil
This oil is specifically designed for 2-stroke (or 2-cycle) engines. 2-stroke engines are typically ""total-loss lubrication"" engines, meaning that this oil will burn up in the combustion chamber when the engine is on and will need to be replaced regularly. Common uses of 2-stroke oil are some motorcycles, lawnmowers, snowmobiles, marine outboard motors, and other small-engine devices. Conventional Motor Oil
This oil is a conventional motor oil, meaning it is refined from crude oil or petroleum products. Conventional motor oils may or may not have additives included after refining. Conventional motor oils are more versatile than synthetic or hybrid motor oils, because they are suitable for use with nearly all types of modern vehicle engines, from cars and trucks to motorcycles, ATVs, farm equipment, and more.",confidence,0.9
