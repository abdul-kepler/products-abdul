The Iconic and classic pacifiers appearance captures a look that’s both timeless and elegant.
𝗜𝗡𝗖𝗟𝗨𝗗𝗘𝗦 𝟮 𝗣𝗔𝗖𝗜𝗙𝗜𝗘𝗥𝗦: Each purchase includes 2 premium baby pacifiers in a variety of beautiful colors and tones which are distinctively BIBS.

However, latex is subject to natural material fluctuations which can become noticeable through a different optical appearance. Therefore, the nipple can vary in clearness and colour. The quality or product safety is not affected by our use of natural rubber latex.
𝗖𝗔𝗥𝗘 𝗜𝗡𝗦𝗧𝗥𝗨𝗖𝗧𝗜𝗢𝗡𝗦: Sterilize each pacifier before use by pouring boiling water over it, squeezing any remaining water out, and letting dry for 4–6 hours. We recommend a replacement every 4-6 weeks for both safety and hygienic reasons. Rubber latex is a natural material and is affected by sunlight, high temperatures, and moisture.

B07TDN9MKC,title,"Philips Avent Soothie Orthodontic Baby Pacifiers, 100% Silicone Pacifiers, One Piece, BPA-Free, for ",primary_use,calming newborns
https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07TDN9MKC,description,"Philips Avent Soothie one-piece newborn pacifiers are specially sized and shaped for babies 0-3 months old and adhere to the American Academy of Pediatrics guidelines¹. The set includes 4 green pacifiers.

Soothies are made of hospital-grade, BPA-free and latex-free silicone for comfort and durability. A collapsible, symmetrical-shaped nipple supports healthy oral development and promotes your baby's natural suckling instinct.

The unique finger-held design lets you place your finger in the nipple so parents and caregivers can bond and connect with the baby, making it easier to share the care. This also makes cleaning easy and prevents water from getting trapped in the nipple.

Clean Soothie pacifiers with your sterilizer or submerge them in boiling water. For hygiene reasons, replace soothers after 4 weeks of use.

Soothies are compatible with Soothie Snuggle pacifier holders, a soft animal plush toy for babies to hold. The Soothie and plush toy detach so parts can be cleaned separately.

Philips Avent Soothie is distributed in hospitals nationwide. 92% of moms trust Soothie for their newborns²

¹ American Academy of Pediatrics recommends to “purchase pacifiers that cannot possibly come apart. Those molded of one solid piece of plastic are particularly safe”. (Caring for Your Baby and Young Child: Birth to Age 5, 7th ed. 2019, By American Academy of Pediatrics, Tanya Remer Altmann and David L. Hill, New York: Bantam Books.)
