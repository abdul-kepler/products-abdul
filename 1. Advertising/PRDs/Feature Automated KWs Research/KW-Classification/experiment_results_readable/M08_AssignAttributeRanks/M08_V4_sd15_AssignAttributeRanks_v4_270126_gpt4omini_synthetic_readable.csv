Installation and use
1. Before the cylinder is piping the debris in the pipe must be removed to prevent the debris from entering the cylinder;
2. The medium used in the cylinder should be filtered by a filter element above 40 m before it can be used;
3. In a low temperature environment anti-freezing measures should be taken to prevent the moisture of the system clock from freezing;
4. If the cylinder is removed and not used for a long time pay attention to the surface anti-rust the inlet and exhaust ports should be equipped with dust blocking caps and the piston rod and moving parts should be coated with anti-rust oil.",Variant,2,HLQ25X20
