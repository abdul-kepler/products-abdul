About Leaks: ①Check that the pipes and pipe connections are not damaged. ②Tighten the booster pump mounting bolts. ③Check, clean or replace the filter device, keep the oil circuit free of obstructions and prevent the valve core from being blocked by foreign bodies.】
【IMPORTANT NOTICE BEFORE INSTALLATION】①Please verify your vehicle make, model, year, engine, and OEM part number before installation. Contact-us if you're unsure about compatibility. ② Flush the entire power steering system thoroughly before installing the new pump. ③ Always replace old O-rings and seals on both high-pressure and return hoses. ④ Use only the manufacturer-recommended power steering fluid. ⑤ Do not overtighten mounting bolts. ⑥ Bleed air from the system by turning the steering wheel fully left and right several times before and after starting the engine. ⑦ Professional installation is strongly recommended.",use_cases,Restoring normal functionality of the steering system

Improved Steering Control: The power steering pump enhances steering control by supplying pressurized fluid to the steering gear, reducing the effort required to maneuver the vehicle.
IMPORTANT NOTICE BEFORE INSTALLATION: ①Please verify your vehicle make, model, year, engine, and OEM part number before installation. Contact-us if you're unsure about compatibility. ② Flush the entire power steering system thoroughly before installing the new pump. Contaminated fluid can lead to premature failure. ③ Always replace old O-rings and seals on both high-pressure and return hoses. Reusing worn seals can cause external leaks. ④ Use only the manufacturer-recommended power steering fluid. Mixing fluid types can damage the system. ⑤ Do not overtighten mounting bolts. Excessive torque can crack the pump housing. ⑥ Bleed air from the system by turning the steering wheel fully left and right several times before starting the engine, then repeat after startup. ⑦ Professional installation is strongly recommended. Improper installation may lead to noise, leaks, or loss of power assist.
Signs of a faulty power steering pump(aka: ""power assit pump"" or ""vane pump"") include: ① steering fluid leaks ② squealing noise when steering ③ heavy and jerky steering ④ metal flakes in the fluid ⑤ power steering symbol on dashboard
Precautions for installation: About Noisy: Check whether the resistance of the suction pipe is too high. Check whether the pressure adjustment of the safety valve is too high. The gas in the pump must be evacuated, check the tightness of each joint, prevent air from entering. About Leaking: Check whether the pipes and pipe joints are damaged. Tighten the fixing screws of the booster pump. Check, clean or replace the filter device, keep the oil circuit unblocked, and avoid the valve core being blocked by foreign matter.
How to install the power steering pump: 1. Ensure the vehicle is stationary and disconnect the negative terminal of the battery. 2. Locate the original power steering pump, typically located near the front of the engine, close to the crankshaft and steering system. 3. Using the appropriate tools, loosen and remove the belt from the original power steering pump, making a note of the belt's routing for future installation. 4. Unbolt or remove the fastening screws of the original power steering pump and take it off the vehicle. 5. Align the new power steering pump with the corresponding bracket or base on the vehicle and secure it in place using bolts or fastening screws. 6. Install the belt correctly on the new power steering pump, following the routing recorded from the original pump. 7. Ensure the belt is properly tensioned. 8.

Motor oil is made from crude oil and is used to lubricate, clean, and cool engines. Types of motor oil include conventional, synthetic, diesel, bio-based, hybrid (blends of conventional and synthetic), and recycled oils. Motor oil varies in weight and viscosity, as well as additives that some manufacturers add to the oil during the refining process. A numerical code system created by the Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) grades motor oils according to viscosity--the higher the number between 0 and 60, the more viscous (thicker) the oil is. Most consumer motor oils are graded by two numbers, with the first number indicating cold weather (Winter or ""W"") performance. 2-Stroke Engine Oil
This oil is specifically designed for 2-stroke (or 2-cycle) engines. 2-stroke engines are typically ""total-loss lubrication"" engines, meaning that this oil will burn up in the combustion chamber when the engine is on and will need to be replaced regularly. Common uses of 2-stroke oil are some motorcycles, lawnmowers, snowmobiles, marine outboard motors, and other small-engine devices. Conventional Motor Oil
This oil is a conventional motor oil, meaning it is refined from crude oil or petroleum products. Conventional motor oils may or may not have additives included after refining. Conventional motor oils are more versatile than synthetic or hybrid motor oils, because they are suitable for use with nearly all types of modern vehicle engines, from cars and trucks to motorcycles, ATVs, farm equipment, and more.",audiences,Personal watercraft owners
