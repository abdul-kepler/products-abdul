,bullet_points,"𝗕𝗜𝗕𝗦 𝗣𝗔𝗖𝗜𝗙𝗜𝗘𝗥𝗦: A favorite for both moms and babies for over forty years, the BIBS natural rubber baby pacifier allows your child to self-soothe by exercising their instinctive sucking instinct in the most natural way possible, by mimicking both the shape and soft materials of mothers’ breast. The Iconic and classic pacifiers appearance captures a look that’s both timeless and elegant.
𝗜𝗡𝗖𝗟𝗨𝗗𝗘𝗦 𝟮 𝗣𝗔𝗖𝗜𝗙𝗜𝗘𝗥𝗦: Each purchase includes 2 premium baby pacifiers in a variety of beautiful colors and tones which are distinctively BIBS. Available in 3 sizes in size 1 (0 to 6 Months), size 2 (6 to 18 Months) and size 3 (18 to 36 Months). A pacifier makes the perfect gift for baby girls and baby boys.
𝗠𝗔𝗗𝗘 𝗜𝗡 𝗗𝗘𝗡𝗠𝗔𝗥𝗞: Designed and manufactured in Denmark. BIBS pacifiers are made of the highest quality materials and are 100% free of BPA, PVC and phthalates. Always striving for excellence, BIBS pacifiers are often imitated but never duplicated.
𝗡𝗔𝗧𝗨𝗥𝗔𝗟 𝗥𝗨𝗕𝗕𝗘𝗥 𝗟𝗔𝗧𝗘𝗫: Latex is a natural product with many positive properties like softness, high bite endurance, and tensile strength. However, latex is subject to natural material fluctuations which can become noticeable through a different optical appearance. Therefore, the nipple can vary in clearness and colour. The quality or product safety is not affected by our use of natural rubber latex.
𝗖𝗔𝗥𝗘 𝗜𝗡𝗦𝗧𝗥𝗨𝗖𝗧𝗜𝗢𝗡𝗦: Sterilize each pacifier before use by pouring boiling water over it, squeezing any remaining water out, and letting dry for 4–6 hours. We recommend a replacement every 4-6 weeks for both safety and hygienic reasons. Rubber latex is a natural material and is affected by sunlight, high temperatures, and moisture. If you experience a change in the material, the pacifier must be replaced.",use_cases,Gift for baby girls and baby boys

,description,"Philips Avent Soothie is the pacifier brand distributed in hospitals nationwide, used by doctors & nurses to soothe newborns. Its one piece construction is specially sized and shaped for babies 0-3 months old and adheres to the American Academy of Pediatrics guidelines. Soothie is designed to calm and soothe without inhibiting normal oral development, like the natural development of teeth and gums. Transparent, tasteless and odorless, the nipple is strong and smooth. It won't become sticky, discolored or misshapen. Soothie is made of hospital-grade, BPA-free and latex-free silicone for strength, comfort and durability. It is dishwasher safe and can be sterilized in a sterilizer. Soon all of our Soothies will say Philips Avent; but for a while, you may see some products that say “Soothie, Children’s Medical Ventures” and others that say “Philips Avent” in market. Both are real, authentic Philips Avent Soothies. The product meets CPSC safety requirements and the same high quality standards you’ve come to expect from us.",use_cases,soothing newborns in hospitals

,description,"Philips Avent Soothie one-piece newborn pacifiers are specially sized and shaped for babies 0-3 months old and adhere to the American Academy of Pediatrics guidelines¹. The set includes 4 green pacifiers.

Soothies are made of hospital-grade, BPA-free and latex-free silicone for comfort and durability. A collapsible, symmetrical-shaped nipple supports healthy oral development and promotes your baby's natural suckling instinct.

The unique finger-held design lets you place your finger in the nipple so parents and caregivers can bond and connect with the baby, making it easier to share the care. This also makes cleaning easy and prevents water from getting trapped in the nipple.

Clean Soothie pacifiers with your sterilizer or submerge them in boiling water. For hygiene reasons, replace soothers after 4 weeks of use.

Soothies are compatible with Soothie Snuggle pacifier holders, a soft animal plush toy for babies to hold. The Soothie and plush toy detach so parts can be cleaned separately.

Philips Avent Soothie is distributed in hospitals nationwide. 92% of moms trust Soothie for their newborns²

¹ American Academy of Pediatrics recommends to “purchase pacifiers that cannot possibly come apart. Those molded of one solid piece of plastic are particularly safe”.
