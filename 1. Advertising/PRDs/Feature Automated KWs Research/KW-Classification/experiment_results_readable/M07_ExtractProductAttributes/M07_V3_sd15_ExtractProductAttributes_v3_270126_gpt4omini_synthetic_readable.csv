Note
a. Rolling is not recommended when turfgrass is weak.
b. Try to avoid high intensity rolling on wet soil to avoid soil slumping, which may affect the growth of turfgrass.
c. On overly dry soil, avoid heavy rolling to prevent compaction of the lawn.
d. It should be combined with management measures such as perforation, thinning and harrowing, fertilization and sand mulching.
With sealing plug to effectively prevent leakage
A fast and efficient way to keep your lawn aerated and healthy

Installation and use
1. Before the cylinder is piping the debris in the pipe must be removed to prevent the debris from entering the cylinder;
2. The medium used in the cylinder should be filtered by a filter element above 40 m before it can be used;
3. In a low temperature environment anti-freezing measures should be taken to prevent the moisture of the system clock from freezing;
4. If the cylinder is removed and not used for a long time pay attention to the surface anti-rust the inlet and exhaust ports should be equipped with dust blocking caps and the piston rod and moving parts should be coated with anti-rust oil.",use_cases,Precision movement in machinery
