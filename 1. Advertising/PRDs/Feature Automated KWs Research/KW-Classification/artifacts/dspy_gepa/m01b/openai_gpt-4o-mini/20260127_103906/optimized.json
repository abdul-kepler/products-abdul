Each field must be assessed based on specific criteria to ensure only relevant terms are included. The output format should be in JSON as outlined below.\n\n## Input\n\n- **brand_name**: The parent brand name provided in the product listing.\n- **title**: Product title containing potential brand-related terms.\n- **bullet_points**: Additional product details that might provide insights into sub-brands or technologies.\n- **description**: Further product information, which can contain relevant terms.\n- **manufacturer**: The manufacturer of the product, if different from the brand.\n\n## Output Format\n\n```json\n{\n  \"sub_brands\": [],\n  \"searchable_standards\": [],\n  \"manufacturer\": null\n}\n```\n\n### FIELD 1: sub_brands\n\nSub-brands are named sub-brands, product families, series, or brand-owned technologies within the parent brand.\n\n#### INCLUDE in sub_brands:\n- If customers commonly search Amazon for \"[sub_brand] [brand]\", it qualifies as a sub-brand.\n- Trademarked sub-brand names or named product series (e.g., `ColorStay`, `Cyber Commander Series`).\n- Brand-owned technologies (e.g., `OMNI-HEAT`, `TrueFX`).\n\n#### EXCLUDE from sub_brands:\n- Generic product types, features, size/color variants, and marketing fluff terms (e.g., `Pill Pouch`, `Waterproof`).\n- Non-search terms like `Adapti-Flex Color Lock Technology™`.\n\n### FIELD 2: searchable_standards\n\nThese are universal industry standards that work across multiple brands and are often searched independently from any particular brand.\n\n#### INCLUDE in searchable_standards:\n- Licensed material standards and licensed audio/video tech that shoppers search specifically for (e.g., `Gore-Tex`, `Dolby Atmos`).\n\n#### EXCLUDE from searchable_standards:\n- ISO/industry standards, generic technology standards, brand-specific technologies, eco-certifications, marketing phrases, and overly technical specs (e.g., `USB-C`, `Bluetooth`, `OEKO-TEX`).\n- If in doubt, default to an empty array `[]`.\n\n### FIELD 3: manufacturer\n\nThe manufacturer is the company that manufactures the product, only if different from the brand.\n\n#### RULES:\n- If `manufacturer` is the same as or contains `brand_name` (case-insensitive), set the manufacturer to `null`.\n- Otherwise, provide a JSON object with the full manufacturer name, short name, and whether it is searchable.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"name\": \"Full Manufacturer Name\",\n  \"short\": \"Short Name\",\n  \"searchable\": true/false\n}\n```\n\n### EXAMPLES\n\n- **JBL Earbuds**: Identify 'Vibe Beam' as a sub-brand but not 'Deep Bass Sound' (a marketing phrase).\n- **Owala Bottle**: 'FreeSip' is a sub-brand, 'BlenderBottle' is a known manufacturer, thus searchable.\n- **Revlon Eyeliner**: 'ColorStay' is a sub-brand.\n- **KitchenAid Mitt**: Has no named sub-brand, 'Town & Country Living' is a non-searchable manufacturer.\n- **Transformers Toy**: 'Cyber Commander Series’ is a sub-brand, 'Hasbro' is a searchable manufacturer.\n- **Patagonia Hoody**: No sub-brands, 'NetPlus' not included despite being mentioned as it doesn't meet criteria.\n- **MYHELP Wound Care**: Contains no sub-brands or searchable standards.\n\nThis task requires careful evaluation using the criteria provided to determine the appropriate categorizations and enhance searchability and product identification on platforms like Amazon.",
