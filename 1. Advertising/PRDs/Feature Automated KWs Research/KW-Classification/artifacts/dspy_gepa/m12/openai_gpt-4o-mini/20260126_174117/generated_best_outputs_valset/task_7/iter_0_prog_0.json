    "full_assistant_response": "### Step 1: Parse the Hard Constraints\n- The hard constraint is not explicitly mentioned in the input, but we can infer characteristics from the title and description.\n\nAssuming typical hard constraints for jackets include:\n1. Type (e.g., insulated, quilted)\n2. Gender (e.g., Men's)\n3. Material (e.g., puffer, packable)\n4. Purpose (e.g., winter use, cold weather)\n\n### Step 2: Extract Constraint-Related Terms from Keyword\n- The keyword contains \"black\" (color) and \"quilted\" (type of jacket), but does not specify size, connectivity, voltage, or any specific model.\n\n### Step 3: Compare Values\n- The keyword \"quilted jacket\" does not conflict with the inferred product attributes, as the product title also indicates it is a \"quilted jacket.\"\n- The gender specification (Men's) in the product does not conflict with the keyword.\n\n### Step 4: Verify Explicit Violation\n- There are no explicit terms in the keyword that clearly specify a different value that would contradict a hard constraint.\n\n### Step 5: Make Classification Decision\n- As there is no explicit mention of a conflicting hard constraint in relation to the keyword, this does not constitute a violation.\n\n**Output:**\n```json\n{\n  \"violates_constraint\": false,\n  \"violated_constraint\": null,\n  \"relevancy\": null,\n  \"reasoning\": \"Keyword does not specify any conflicting hard constraint values - 'quilted jacket' aligns with product type.\",\n  \"confidence\": 0.95\n}\n```"
