    "full_assistant_response": "### Step 1: Parse the Hard Constraints\n- **Product Title:** Pioneer Camp Mens Lightweight Packable Puffer Jacket\n- **Hard Constraints Identified:**\n  - **Type/Use:** Insulated Puffer Jacket\n  - **Functionality:** Warmth and water repellent (cold weather use)\n\n### Step 2: Extract Constraint-Related Terms from Keyword\n- **Keyword:** \"travel jacket\"\n- **Terms related to hard constraints:** \n  - **Type:** \"jacket\" is a general term that could encompass various styles, doesn't specify insulation or material directly.\n\n### Step 3: Compare Values\n- The keyword \"travel jacket\" is generic and does not provide specific size, compatibility, or technology constraints that conflict with the product specifications. It suggests a usage context (travel) but does not contradict any of the hard constraints related to type or function.\n\n### Step 4: Verify Explicit Violation\n- The keyword does not specify a different value for size, insulation, or any other hard constraint. It merely states a context of use (travel) which is compatible with the type of jacket described.\n\n### Step 5: Make Classification Decision\n- No explicit hard constraint violation detected based on the analysis.\n\n**Output:**\n```json\n{\n  \"violates_constraint\": false,\n  \"violated_constraint\": null,\n  \"relevancy\": null,\n  \"reasoning\": \"Keyword does not specify size or type that contradicts product specifications - no constraint violation.\",\n  \"confidence\": 0.95\n}\n```"
