    "full_assistant_response": "### Step 1: Parse the Hard Constraints\n- Product Title: Pioneer Camp Mens Lightweight Packable Puffer Jacket\n- Hard Constraints: The hard constraints are not explicitly provided in the input, but we can infer that the primary attributes concern the following:\n  - **Gender:** Mens\n  - **Type:** Jacket\n  - **Use:** Cold weather\n\n### Step 2: Extract Constraint-Related Terms from Keyword\n- Keyword: \"blue jacket\"\n- Related Terms: \n  - \"blue\" (color)\n  - \"jacket\" (type)\n\n### Step 3: Compare Values\n- **Color**: \n  - The product does not specify a color constraint in the title or any hard constraints given. Hence, \"blue\" does not conflict with any specified value since the color is likely not a hard constraint.\n  \n### Step 4: Verify Explicit Violation\n- The keyword \"blue jacket\" does not explicitly request a specific model or size that contradicts any non-negotiable attributes from the product.\n- Since \u201ccolor\u201d generally is not considered a hard constraint in terms of compatibility or product functionality, there is no violation.\n\n### Step 5: Make Classification Decision\n- Since there are no explicit hard constraint violations in the keyword relative to the product attributes presented, we conclude there is no violation.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"violates_constraint\": false,\n  \"violated_constraint\": null,\n  \"relevancy\": null,\n  \"reasoning\": \"Color 'blue' is not a hard constraint in this context, and does not violate any specified product attributes.\",\n  \"confidence\": 0.95\n}\n```"
