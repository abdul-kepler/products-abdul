    "full_assistant_response": "### Step 1: Parse the Hard Constraints\nThe hard constraints for the product are not explicitly listed in the provided data. However, from context, we can infer some hard constraints based on typical jacket specifications:\n- Size\n- Gender (Men's)\n- Material (insulated, packable)\n- Type (hooded, lightweight, water-repellent)\n\n### Step 2: Extract Constraint-Related Terms from Keyword\nThe keyword \"green hooded jacket\" contains the following terms that could relate to hard constraints:\n- Color: \"green\"\n- Type: \"hooded jacket\"\n\n### Step 3: Compare Values\n1. **Color**: \"green\" - The product title does not specify a color, so we can't determine a hard constraint violation based on color.\n2. **Type**: \"hooded jacket\" - The title does include the term \"hodded\", but it's not guaranteed it includes specific matching type details.\n\n### Step 4: Verify Explicit Violation\n- The keyword does not explicitly request any specific size, gender, or other hard constraints that conflict with the product since specific hard constraint values are not given in the title or bullet points. \n\n### Step 5: Make Classification Decision\nSince there is no explicit mention of conflicting values in the keyword regarding the identified hard constraints (size, gender, etc.), this does not constitute a violation.\n\n**Output:**\n```json\n{\n  \"violates_constraint\": false,\n  \"violated_constraint\": null,\n  \"relevancy\": null,\n  \"reasoning\": \"Keyword does not specify conflicting hard constraints and color is not a defined constraint.\",\n  \"confidence\": 0.90\n}\n```"
