    "full_assistant_response": "### Step 1: Parse the Hard Constraints\n- Based on the title provided, the hard constraints seem to include:\n  - Product Type: \"Jacket\"\n  - Gender: \"Mens\"\n  - Specific Features: \"Lightweight\", \"Packable\", \"Insulated\", \"Water Repellent\"\n\n### Step 2: Extract Constraint-Related Terms from Keyword\n- The keyword \"Black Fleece Jacket\" mentions:\n  - Color: \"Black\"\n  - Material Type: \"Fleece\"\n  - Type: \"Jacket\"\n\n### Step 3: Compare Values\n- The hard constraints do not mention a specific color or material type, but they do include gender specificity. \n- The keyword does not conflict in terms of the product type since both are jackets.\n- Color is not a hard constraint, and fleece material does not match the descriptive attributes but isn't listed as a hard constraint either.\n\n### Step 4: Verify Explicit Violation\n- There is no explicit request for a different gender in the keyword. The keyword is generic regarding color and material, which do not appear in the hard constraints.\n\n### Step 5: Make Classification Decision\n- Since there are no explicit conflicts with the hard constraints based on the provided information, there are no violations.\n\n**Output:**\n```json\n{\n  \"violates_constraint\": false,\n  \"violated_constraint\": null,\n  \"relevancy\": null,\n  \"reasoning\": \"Keyword does not specify conflicting values with hard constraints; no explicit violation.\",\n  \"confidence\": 0.95\n}\n```"
