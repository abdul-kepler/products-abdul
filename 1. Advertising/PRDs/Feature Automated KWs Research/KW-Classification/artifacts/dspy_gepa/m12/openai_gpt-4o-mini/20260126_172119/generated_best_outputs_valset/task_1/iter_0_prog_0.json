    "full_assistant_response": "### Step 1: Parse the Hard Constraints\n- The provided input does not specify any hard constraints explicitly. However, we can infer possible hard constraints for a product like a \"jacket\" based on typical attributes like size, gender, or specific model details.\n\n### Step 2: Extract Constraint-Related Terms from Keyword\n- Keyword: \"blue jacket\"\n- The keyword specifies the color (\"blue\") and the type of product (\"jacket\"). \n\n### Step 3: Compare Values\n- With no explicit hard constraints defined in the input, we cannot compare \"blue\" color or \"jacket\" type against product-specific constraints. The description indicates this is a type of men's puffer jacket, but without defined hard constraints.\n\n### Step 4: Verify Explicit Violation\n- Since there are no specified hard constraints in the product attributes, we cannot confirm any explicit violations. The keyword does not request or specify a different value that conflicts with an established hard constraint.\n\n### Step 5: Make Classification Decision\n- As there are no explicit hard constraints to check against, we do not find any violations.\n\nThus, the classification will allow passage to the next module.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"violates_constraint\": false,\n  \"violated_constraint\": null,\n  \"relevancy\": null,\n  \"reasoning\": \"No hard constraints were specified to compare against the keyword; therefore, no violations found.\",\n  \"confidence\": 0.9\n}\n```"
