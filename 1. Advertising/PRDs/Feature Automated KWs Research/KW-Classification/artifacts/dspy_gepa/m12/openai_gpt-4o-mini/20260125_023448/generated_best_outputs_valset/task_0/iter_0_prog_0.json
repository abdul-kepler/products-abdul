    "full_assistant_response": "### Step 1: Parse the Hard Constraints\nThe hard constraints for the product can be inferred from the title and description, but explicit values are not provided. Typical hard constraints for clothing include size (S, M, L), gender (Men's, Women's), and features (e.g., waterproof, insulated). In this case, I will assume:\n\n- **Gender**: Men's\n- **Type**: Jacket (specifically, a puffer jacket)\n\n### Step 2: Extract Constraint-Related Terms from Keyword\nThe keyword \"green hooded jacket\" mentions the following aspects:\n- Color: Green\n- Type: Hooded jacket\n\n### Step 3: Compare Values\n1. **Gender**: No explicit gender mentioned in the keyword, but product is Men's. No violation.\n2. **Type**: The keyword specifies \"jacket\", which is compatible with the product type (puffer jacket). No violation.\n3. **Color**: The keyword specifies \"green\", which is a color preference. Color is not typically a hard constraint. No violation.\n\n### Step 4: Verify Explicit Violation\nThere is no explicit request for a different value attributed to a hard constraint:\n- No contradictions in gender.\n- Compatible jacket type.\n- Color is not a hard constraint.\n\n### Step 5: Make Classification Decision\nSince there are no explicit violations of the hard constraints, I will classify this as a \"no violation\".\n\n```json\n{\n  \"violates_constraint\": false,\n  \"violated_constraint\": null,\n  \"relevancy\": null,\n  \"reasoning\": \"Keyword specifies a color and type compatible with the product, with no hard constraint violations.\",\n  \"confidence\": 0.95\n}\n```"
