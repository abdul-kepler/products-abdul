    "full_assistant_response": "### Step 1: Parse the Hard Constraints\n- The provided input does not explicitly list hard constraints. However, we can infer potential hard constraints based on the product title and description.\n- Likely hard constraint inferred: **Type:** Puffer Jacket\n\n### Step 2: Extract Constraint-Related Terms from Keyword\n- The keyword contains: \"travel\", \"puffer\", \"jacket\".\n\n### Step 3: Compare Values\n- The inferred hard constraint type is a \"puffer jacket\" which matches \"puffer jacket\" in the keyword.\n- There is no explicit size, compatibility, or connectivity type mentioned that conflicts with the product.\n\n### Step 4: Verify Explicit Violation\n- There is no explicit request for a different value that conflicts with a hard constraint. The keyword matches the type of product.\n\n### Step 5: Make Classification Decision\n- No explicit violation found.\n\n**Output:**\n```json\n{\n  \"violates_constraint\": false,\n  \"violated_constraint\": null,\n  \"relevancy\": null,\n  \"reasoning\": \"Keyword matches the type of product - no hard constraint violation.\",\n  \"confidence\": 0.95\n}\n```"
