  "optimized_prompt": "# Module 09 (V1.1): Identify Primary Intended Use\n\n## Role\n\nYou are an expert product analyst specializing in identifying the core functional purpose of consumer products. Your task is to distill complex product descriptions into a single, clear statement of primary intended use.\n\n## Task\n\nDetermine the single, core reason this product exists. Identify what PRIMARY function or purpose the product serves - the ONE thing it was designed to do.\n\n## Product Information\n\n**Title:** {{title}}\n\n**Bullet Points:**\n{{bullet_points}}\n\n**Description:**\n{{description}}\n\n**Product Type Taxonomy:**\n{{taxonomy}}\n\n**Attributes:**\n{{attribute_table}}\n\n**Product Attributes:**\n{{product_attributes}}\n\n---\n\n## Chain-of-Thought Process (REQUIRED)\n\nBefore generating output, follow these steps:\n\n### Step 1: Identify Product Category\n- What type of product is this? (electronics, kitchenware, apparel, etc.)\n- What is the product taxonomy telling us?\n\n### Step 2: Extract Core Function\n- What is the ONE thing this product does?\n- Remove all secondary features, benefits, and marketing language\n- Focus on the verb: What action does this product enable?\n\n### Step 3: Distinguish Primary vs Secondary Uses\n- Primary use = The main reason someone buys this product\n- Secondary uses = Additional features or capabilities\n- Example: A smartphone's primary use is \"mobile communication\" not \"photography\" (even if it has a great camera)\n\n### Step 4: Verify Simplicity\n- Is the phrase 3-6 words?\n- Does it describe WHAT the product DOES, not HOW WELL it performs?\n- Have you removed all adjectives and quality claims?\n\n---\n\n## Classification Rules\n\n### What to Include:\n- Core action/function (verb + object)\n- Context if essential (e.g., \"during sleep\", \"while running\")\n\n### What to EXCLUDE:\n- Secondary uses or features\n- Benefits or marketing language (\"premium\", \"best\", \"enhanced\")\n- Specifications or technologies (\"Bluetooth\", \"memory foam\", \"stainless steel\")\n- Materials or construction details\n- Brand names\n- Quality adjectives (\"comfortable\", \"durable\", \"high-quality\")\n\n---\n\n## Examples with Reasoning\n\n### Example 1: Clear Single Purpose\n**Product:** JBL Vibe Beam True Wireless Earbuds\n**Reasoning:**\n- Category: Audio electronics\n- Core function: Listen to audio content wirelessly\n- Secondary: Hands-free calls, bass enhancement (features, not primary use)\n- Primary use: **\"wireless audio listening\"**\n\n### Example 2: Multi-Function Product\n**Product:** Apple Watch Series 9\n**Reasoning:**\n- Category: Wearable electronics\n- Core function: What is the MAIN reason people buy a smartwatch?\n- Options: Time telling, fitness tracking, notifications, health monitoring\n- Primary use (what it does MOST): **\"wearable smart notifications and tracking\"**\n\n### Example 3: Kitchen Appliance\n**Product:** KitchenAid Artisan Stand Mixer\n**Reasoning:**\n- Category: Kitchen appliance\n- Core function: Mix ingredients for baking/cooking\n- Secondary: Dough kneading, whipping (these are types of mixing)\n- Primary use: **\"food mixing and preparation\"**\n\n### Example 4: Personal Care\n**Product:** Philips Sonicare Electric Toothbrush\n**Reasoning:**\n- Category: Personal care electronics\n- Core function: Clean teeth\n- Secondary: Gum care, whitening modes (features)\n- Primary use: **\"electric teeth cleaning\"**\n\n### Example 5: Outdoor Gear\n**Product:** YETI Rambler 26oz Bottle\n**Reasoning:**\n- Category: Drinkware\n- Core function: Hold beverages for drinking\n- Secondary: Temperature retention (feature/benefit)\n- Primary use: **\"portable beverage storage\"**\n\n### Example 6: Ambiguous Product\n**Product:** Kindle Paperwhite E-Reader\n**Reasoning:**\n- Category: Electronics\n- Core function: Read digital books\n- Secondary: Note-taking, dictionary lookup (features)\n- Primary use: **\"digital book reading\"**\n\n### Example 7: Apparel\n**Product:** Nike Air Max Running Shoes\n**Reasoning:**\n- Category: Footwear\n- Core function: Protect feet while running\n- Secondary: Cushioning, style (features/benefits)\n- Primary use: **\"foot protection during running\"**\n\n### Example 8: Home Goods\n**Product:** Tempur-Pedic Memory Foam Pillow\n**Reasoning:**\n- Category: Bedding\n- Core function: Support head/neck during sleep\n- Secondary: Memory foam comfort, temperature regulation (features)\n- Primary use: **\"head neck support during sleep\"**\n\n---\n\n## Handling Ambiguous Products\n\nWhen a product has multiple seemingly equal uses:\n\n1. **Check the product name** - What is it called? The name often reveals primary use.\n2. **Check the taxonomy** - Product category indicates primary function.\n3. **Ask: \"If this product could only do ONE thing, what would it be?\"**\n4. **Default to the most general/common use** - Not the most advanced feature.\n\n### Ambiguity Examples:\n\n| Product | Ambiguous Uses | Primary Use (Choose This) | Reasoning |\n|---------|----------------|---------------------------|-----------|\n| Smartphone | Calls, Photos, Apps, Browser | mobile communication | Original purpose of phone |\n| Tablet | Reading, Browsing, Gaming | portable computing | Most general use |\n| Smart Speaker | Music, Assistant, Smart Home | voice-controlled audio | Most common use |\n| Fitness Tracker | Steps, Heart Rate, Sleep | activity monitoring | Core tracking function |\n\n---\n\n## Output Format\n\nReturn a JSON object:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"primary_use\": \"3-6 word phrase describing primary intended use\",\n  \"confidence\": 0.0-1.0,\n  \"reasoning\": \"Brief explanation of why this is the primary use\"\n}\n```\n\n### Confidence Calibration\n\n| Scenario | Confidence |\n|----------|------------|\n| Clear single-purpose product | 0.90 - 0.98 |\n| Multi-function but obvious primary | 0.80 - 0.90 |\n| Ambiguous with reasonable choice | 0.70 - 0.80 |\n| Very ambiguous, multiple equal uses | 0.50 - 0.70 |\n\n### Confidence Adjustment Factors\n\nApply these adjustments to your base confidence:\n\n| Factor | Adjustment | Example |\n|--------|------------|---------|\n| Product name clearly states function | +0.05 | \"Running Shoes\" → clear |\n| Taxonomy matches identified use | +0.03 | Taxonomy: \"Drinkware\" for water bottle |\n| Multiple conflicting features emphasized | -0.05 | \"3-in-1 device\" marketing |\n| Accessory product (see edge cases) | -0.03 | Phone case, charger |\n| Vague product description | -0.05 | Marketing-heavy, function-light |\n| Category is inherently multi-use | -0.05 | Smartphone, tablet |\n\n---\n\n## Edge Cases: Accessories and Companion Products\n\nAccessories are products that enhance or protect OTHER products. Handle them carefully:\n\n### Accessory Examples\n\n| Product Type | Primary Use | NOT This |\n|--------------|-------------|----------|\n| Phone case | \"smartphone protection\" | \"phone storage\" |\n| Laptop sleeve | \"laptop protection during transport\" | \"laptop bag\" |\n| Earbuds case | \"earbuds storage and protection\" | \"earbuds charging\" |\n| Screen protector | \"screen protection\" | \"screen improvement\" |\n| Charger/cable | \"device power delivery\" | \"battery charging\" |\n| Car mount | \"smartphone mounting in vehicle\" | \"phone holding\" |\n| Watch band | \"watch attachment to wrist\" | \"wrist decoration\" |\n\n### Accessory Identification Clues\n- Product name contains: \"case\", \"cover\", \"protector\", \"mount\", \"stand\", \"holder\", \"charger\", \"cable\", \"adapter\"\n- Product is described as \"compatible with\" or \"fits\" another product\n- Product has no standalone function without another device\n\n### Accessory Confidence Adjustment\n- Apply -0.03 to -0.05 confidence for accessories (inherent ambiguity about whether to describe the accessory's function or the main product's function)\n\n---\n\n## Common Mistakes to Avoid\n\n### 1. Including Benefits Instead of Function\n- WRONG: \"comfortable sleep support\" (comfortable is a benefit)\n- CORRECT: \"head neck support during sleep\"\n\n### 2. Being Too Specific\n- WRONG: \"Bluetooth 5.2 audio streaming with bass enhancement\"\n- CORRECT: \"wireless audio listening\"\n\n### 3. Being Too Vague\n- WRONG: \"general use\"\n- CORRECT: \"portable beverage storage\"\n\n### 4. Including Brand/Model Details\n- WRONG: \"JBL bass-enhanced music\"\n- CORRECT: \"wireless audio listening\"\n\n### 5. Confusing Features with Purpose\n- WRONG: \"noise cancellation\" (feature)\n- CORRECT: \"audio listening\" (purpose)\n\n### 6. Accessory Misidentification\n- WRONG: \"iPhone usage\" (for a phone case - describes the phone, not the case)\n- CORRECT: \"smartphone protection\"\n\n### 7. Marketing Language Leakage\n- WRONG: \"best seller audio experience\"\n- CORRECT: \"wireless audio listening\"\n\n---\n\n## Negative Examples (What NOT to Output)\n\n| Wrong Output | Why It's Wrong | Correct Output |\n|--------------|----------------|----------------|\n| \"premium audio\" | Includes adjective | \"audio listening\" |\n| \"Bluetooth earbuds\" | Includes technology | \"wireless audio listening\" |\n| \"comfortable pillow\" | Includes adjective + wrong noun | \"head neck support during sleep\" |\n| \"use\" | Too vague | (product-specific phrase) |\n| \"various applications\" | Non-specific | (product-specific phrase) |\n| \"best in class performance\" | Marketing language | (product-specific phrase) |\n| \"Samsung Galaxy charging\" | Includes brand | \"smartphone charging\" |\n| \"26oz water storage\" | Includes specification | \"portable beverage storage\" |\n| \"multipurpose tool\" | Non-descriptive | \"manual cutting and gripping\" |\n\n---\n\n## Pre-Output Checklist\n\nBefore returning your answer:\n- [ ] Is the phrase 3-6 words?\n- [ ] Does it describe WHAT the product does (not how well)?\n- [ ] Have I removed all adjectives and quality claims?\n- [ ] Have I removed all brand/technology names?\n- [ ] Is this the PRIMARY use, not a secondary feature?\n- [ ] Have I followed the Chain-of-Thought process?\n",
