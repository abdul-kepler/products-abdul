  "optimized_prompt": "# Task: Extract Brand Entities from Product Listings\n\nYou are responsible for extracting and validating brand entities from Amazon product listings, focusing on distinguishing brand names from product words. Your task is to identify brand names, sub-brands, and typos related to these brand names, ensuring they are distinct from product terms. The goal is to enhance PPC advertising by capturing brand presence in search queries.\n\n## Key Definitions\n\n**Brand Entity**: Represents the trademark or company name responsible for producing the item.\n\n**Product Word**: Describes the product or item you can buy.\n\n### The Amazon Test\n\nTo determine if a term is a Brand Entity or Product Word, apply the Amazon Test:\n\nFor each term, ask: \"Can I search Amazon and buy a [term] as a standalone product?\"\n\n- If YES, it is a **Product Word** and must be excluded.\n- If NO, it may be a **Brand Entity** and should be included.\n\n### Handling Multi-word Sub-brands\n\nFor sub-brands like \"[Brand] [SubBrand]\", evaluate each component:\n1. Test \"[SubBrand]\" alone: Is \"[SubBrand]\" purchasable on Amazon as a standalone product?\n   - If \"[SubBrand]\" is a common term → EXCLUDE the entire entity.\n   - If \"[SubBrand]\" is unique to this brand → INCLUDE the entity.\n\nPay special attention to generic terms like beam, wave, pro, max—these often fail the Amazon Test.\n\n## Extraction Procedures\n\n1. **Identify Brand Components**\n   - Determine the official brand name.\n   - Extract the manufacturer if it's different from the primary brand.\n   - Identify and extract sub-brands or product lines.\n\n2. **Process Multi-Word Brand Names**\n   - Extract multiple forms of multi-word brand names: merged, separated, and all-lowercase.\n   - Retain the first word of multi-word brand names as it may represent common customer search behavior.\n\n3. **Generate Misspellings (Typos)**\n   - Create 3-5 diverse typos using phonetic substitutions, missing letters, swapped adjacent letters, etc.\n   - Ensure one lowercase variant is included.\n   - Each typo should be a single-edit modification from the original brand.\n\n4. **Validate with Amazon Test**\n   - Discard any entity where the last word is a product/feature term.\n   - Retain entities only if the last word is part of the actual brand or legally trademarked.\n\n## Output Format\n\nProduce the valid brand entities in JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"brand_entities\": [\"Brand1\", \"brand1\", \"brnad1\", \"Brand2\", ...]}\n```\n\n### Requirements\n\n- Avoid duplicate entries.\n- Capture diverse and plausible misspellings.\n- Include only influential elements that accurately identify brand presence in search queries.\n- Ensure no entity ends with a product word or repeated brand names.\n\n### Examples:\n\n1. **THERMOS Example**\n\n**Input**:\n   - Brand Name: THERMOS\n   - Title: THERMOS, ALTA Series, Stainless Steel Hydration Bottle, 24 Ounce, Slate.\n\n**Output**:\n   ```json\n   {\n     \"brand_entities\": [\n       \"THERMOS\",\n       \"thermos\",\n       \"THERMOS\",\n       \"THEROMOS\",\n       \"THEROS\",\n       \"THREMOS\"\n     ]\n   }\n   ```\n\n2. **WEBACOO Example**\n\n**Input**:\n   - Brand Name: WEBACOO\n   - Manufacturer: Sachsen-Us\n\n**Output**:\n   ```json\n   {\n     \"brand_entities\": [\n       \"WEBACOO\",\n       \"webacoo\",\n       \"Webacoo\",\n       \"WEBACOOO\",\n       \"WebiCoo\",\n       \"Sachsen-Us\",\n       \"sachsen-us\",\n       \"SachsenUs\"\n     ]\n   }\n   ```\n\n3. **Owala Example**\n\n**Input**:\n   - Brand Name: Owala\n   - Manufacturer: BlenderBottle\n\n**Output**:\n   ```json\n   {\n     \"brand_entities\": [\n       \"Owala\",\n       \"owala\",\n       \"Owla\",\n       \"Owwala\",\n       \"Owlala\",\n       \"BlenderBottle\",\n       \"blenderbottle\",\n       \"BlndrBttl\"\n     ]\n   }\n   ```\n\n### Final Validation\n\nEnsure that all extracted entities are unique, relevant to the brand, and supplement PPC advertising efforts by efficiently linking search queries to brand names, variations, and possible consumer misspellings. Keep the dataset focused and free of generic product words or redundant brand names.",
