  "optimized_prompt": "# Task: GenerateBrandNameVariations\n\nGenerate realistic and diverse brand name search variations for Amazon PPC campaigns.\n\n## Input\n\n- **brand_name**: The main brand name for which variations need to be generated.\n\n## Output Format\n\nReturn a JSON object containing a \"variations\" array with exactly 10 to 14 unique strings representing different variations of the brand name:\n\n```json\n{\"variations\": [\"ExampleBrand\", \"examplebrand\", \"ExaplmrBrand\", ...]}\n```\n\n## STRICT RULES\n\n1. **EXACTLY 10-14 variations** — no more, no less\n2. **NO DUPLICATES** — ensure each variation is unique based on character composition.\n3. **First item = correct brand spelling** — maintain the original input casing and spacing.\n4. **Strings only** — no numbers, symbols, or nested objects.\n\n## Variation Categories\n\nGenerate variations using the following categories:\n\n### 1. CANONICAL (1 item)\n- The correct spelling of the brand and always the first element of the array.\n\n### 2. CASE/SPACING (2-4 items)\n- Variations in casing:\n  - Fully lowercase: `BrandName` → `brandname`\n  - Camel case with spaces: `BrandName` → `Brand Name`, `b r a n d n a m e`\n- Variations in spacing:\n  - Removal of spaces or adding hyphens: `Brand Name` → `Brand-Name`\n\n### 3. TRUNCATION (0-1 item)\n- Omit the second word if the brand name has two or more words and the first word is distinctive.\n- Avoid if the first word is generic or if truncation doesn't apply (e.g., acronyms or very short brands).\n\n### 4. KEYBOARD TYPOS (2-3 items)\n- Introduce typos by replacing characters with adjacent keys on a QWERTY keyboard:\n  - `BrandName` → `BrabdName`, `BrandNmae`\n\n### 5. PHONETIC/SPELLING ERRORS (2-3 items)\n- Sounds-like errors or common misspellings:\n  - Common misinterpretation: `BrandName` → `BrindName`\n  - Sound-alike errors: `Brand` → `Brind`, doubling letters or missing letters.\n\n### 6. SINGULAR/PLURAL (1-2 items)\n- If the brand name ends in 's', provide singular forms and vice versa:\n  - `Brands` → `Brand`\n- Avoid if the name is an acronym or singular/plural transformation isn't applicable.\n\n## Checklist before Output\n\n- **SCAN FOR DUPLICATES** — Ensure all strings are unique using a character composition check.\n- Total items in the array should be between 10-14.\n- First item should always be the correct brand spelling.\n- Ensure inclusion of truncation if applicable.\n- Must include lowercase version.\n- Ensure at least two typographical errors are included.\n- Include singular/plural forms if applicable.\n- Space-insertions or hyphenated versions should be included if the brand uses CamelCase or Multi-word names.\n\n## DO NOT INCLUDE\n\n- Sub-brands or specific product names.\n- Category words (like 'bottle' or 'earbuds').\n- Numbers, symbols or nested objects.\n- Variations with embedded errors (like trailing characters that don’t follow the task rules).\n\nWith these instructions, your task is to generate search-friendly brand name variations that accommodate realistic user entries and capture common misspellings and typographic patterns users might use when searching for a brand name online.",
