This involves analyzing buyer intent and product functionality to assess if products within the same category serve the same primary purpose. \n\n## Task Overview\n\nGiven inputs related to a product's demonstrated purpose and a keyword representing another product of the same type, assess if both products serve the identical primary use.\n\n## Inputs\n\n- **Keyword**: String representing the product search term.\n- **Validated Use**: String indicating the main function of the ASIN, representing buyer's intent and primary purpose.\n\n## Outputs\n\n- A single character string: **\"R\"** for Relevant if the primary use matches, or **\"N\"** for Negative if they do not match.\n\n## Steps for Determining Primary Use Match\n\n1. **Identify ASIN Primary Use:**\n   - Reference the Validated Use field to ascertain and clearly state the ASIN's primary purpose.\n\n2. **Analyze Keyword Implied Use:**\n   - Examine the keyword to determine the primary use it implies.\n   - Identify context words that might suggest a particular use-case, which include characteristics like \"decorative,\" \"gaming,\" \"travel,\" or \"professional.\"\n\n3. **Compare Core Functions:**\n   - Evaluate if the primary function/service implied by the keyword aligns with the ASIN's function.\n   - Consider whether a consumer seeking the keyword would expect the ASIN's primary use as their main goal.\n\n4. **Check for Use-Case Divergence:**\n   - Establish if the products share the same fundamental use or if they apply to different contexts (e.g., decorative vs. functional, gaming vs. music).\n\n5. **Decision Making:**\n   - If they serve the same primary purpose, classify as \"R\" (Relevant).\n   - If they do not share the same primary purpose, classify as \"N\" (Negative).\n\n## Critical Understanding\n\n- **Superficial vs. Core Differences**: Avoid focusing on superficial differences such as material, design, brand, or added features. Concentrate on whether the product serves the same fundamental role.\n- **Primary Use Contexts**:\n  - Same use span variations in material, form, character, brand, features, color, and size.\n  - Different use signifies fundamentally different purposes despite similar product types.\n\n## Common Scenarios & Considerations\n\n- **Same Use Example**: A \"winter jacket with hood\" validating cold weather body warmth can be marked as \"R\" since it aligns with a primary use of providing warmth.\n- **Different Use Example**: If a keyword is \"decorative pillow,\" but the ASIN is functional (for sleep support), classify as \"N.\"\n- **Feature Enhancements**: Recognize enhancements like \"waterproof\" or \"nonslip\" as not altering the core use.\n- **Subset vs. Different Function**: Determine if the keyword is a subset of the validated use (→ R) or represents a different primary function (→ N).\n\n## Key Insight\n\nOnly when the fundamental purpose diverges should a product be classified as \"N.\" For cases with partial overlaps or enhancements, defer to \"R\" if the overarching primary function is maintained.",
