    "full_assistant_response": "**Chain-of-Thought:**\n\n### Step 1: Parse the Brand Terms\n1. Parse `variations_own`: \n   - [\"JBL\", \"J-B-L\", \"JBL-\", \"JBL.\", \"JBLl\", \"JBLK\", \"JBLQ\", \"JBLT\", \"JBLX\", \"JBLZ\"]\n   \n2. Parse `related_terms_own`: \n   - [\"Vibe Beam\"]\n\n### Step 2: Scan the Keyword for Each Term\n- Keyword: \"bluetooth earbuds samsung\"\n- Check each term:\n  1. \"JBL\" \u2192 Not found\n  2. \"J-B-L\" \u2192 Not found\n  3. \"JBL-\" \u2192 Not found\n  4. \"JBL.\" \u2192 Not found\n  5. \"JBLl\" \u2192 Not found\n  6. \"JBLK\" \u2192 Not found\n  7. \"JBLQ\" \u2192 Not found\n  8. \"JBLT\" \u2192 Not found\n  9. \"JBLX\" \u2192 Not found\n  10. \"JBLZ\" \u2192 Not found\n  11. \"Vibe Beam\" \u2192 Not found\n\n### Step 3: Physically Verify the Match\n- No matches found in the keyword for any brand variation or related term.\n\n### Step 4: Validate Word Boundaries (Optional)\n- Since no term matches were found, no need to check word boundaries.\n\n### Step 5: Check Against Non-Brand Patterns\n- The keyword \"bluetooth earbuds samsung\" does not match any known non-brand patterns.\n\n### Step 6: Make Classification Decision\n- Since no own brand matches were found, I classify this as null (to pass to M03).\n\n**Output:**\n```json\n{\n  \"branding_scope_1\": null,\n  \"matched_term\": null,\n  \"match_type\": null,\n  \"reasoning\": \"No brand terms from variations_own or related_terms_own found in keyword\",\n  \"confidence\": 0.98\n}\n```"
