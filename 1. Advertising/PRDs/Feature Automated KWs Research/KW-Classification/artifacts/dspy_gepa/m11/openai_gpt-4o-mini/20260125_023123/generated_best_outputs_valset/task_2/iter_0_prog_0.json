NO, other sizes can still serve as action figures - NOT hard constraint. Robot-to-Truck Conversion: Remove entirely? YES, without it, it's just a static figure - MECHANISM for play - HARD CONSTRAINT. 6-Step Conversion: Remove entirely? YES, but a figure can still be played with if it requires more steps - not the simplistic conversion itself that's essential - NOT hard constraint. Cyber Commander Series: Remove entirely? NO, can still have action figures that aren't part of this series - NOT hard constraint. Optimus Prime Character: Remove entirely? NO, action figure can be another character - NOT hard constraint. Conclusion: 1 hard constraint.\",\n  \"hard_constraints\": [\"Robot-to-Truck Conversion\"]\n}\n```"
