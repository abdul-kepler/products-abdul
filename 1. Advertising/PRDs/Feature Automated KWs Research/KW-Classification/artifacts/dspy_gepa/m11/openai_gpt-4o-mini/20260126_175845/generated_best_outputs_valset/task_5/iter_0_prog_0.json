Waterproof: If removed entirely, the product could still draw lines, so NOT a hard constraint. Smudge-Proof: Even without it, the product can still draw lines, so NOT a hard constraint. 24-Hour Wear: Product can still create visible lines even if it wears off quickly, so NOT a hard constraint. Built-in Sharpener: Removing this would mean needing a separate sharpener, but it does not affect the ability to draw lines, so NOT a hard constraint. Built-in Smudger: Can still draw lines without it, so NOT a hard constraint. Black Brown: This is a color choice, and removing it would still allow the primary function of drawing lines, so NOT a hard constraint. Matte Finish: This is an aesthetic quality; even without it, lines can still be drawn, so NOT a hard constraint. Conclusion: 0 hard constraints.\",\n  \"hard_constraints\": []\n}\n```"
