MECHANISM - HARD CONSTRAINT. 26Lbs/24Hrs Capacity: Without this, it can still produce ice, just less frequently. QUALITY - NOT hard. Two Ice Sizes: The machine could still make ice, but only one size; it's not essential to make ice at all. QUALITY - NOT hard. Self-Cleaning Function: This doesn\u2019t affect the core function, just maintenance. CONVENIENCE - NOT hard. Quiet Operation (\u226440dB): The operation noise doesn\u2019t affect the ability to make ice. NOT hard. Conclusion: 1 hard constraint.\",\n  \"hard_constraints\": [\"8 Cubes in 6 Minutes\"]\n}\n```"
