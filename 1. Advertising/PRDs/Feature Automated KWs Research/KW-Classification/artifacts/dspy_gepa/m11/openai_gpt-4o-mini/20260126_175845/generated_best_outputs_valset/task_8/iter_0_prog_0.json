NO impact on function - action figure can still exist at a different size. MECHANISM or QUALITY? QUALITY - NOT hard constraint. Robot-to-Truck Conversion: Remove entirely? YES - without this, it can't transform, which is core to play. MECHANISM - HARD CONSTRAINT. 6-Step Conversion: Remove entirely? YES - but it doesn't prevent transformation; it only affects ease of use. MECHANISM - NOT hard constraint. Cyber Commander Series: Remove entirely? NO impact on function - not essential for play. MECHANISM or QUALITY? QUALITY - NOT hard constraint. Optimus Prime Character: Remove entirely? NO impact on function - could have another character. MECHANISM or QUALITY? QUALITY - NOT hard constraint. Considering these, the only hard constraint is the Robot-to-Truck Conversion which is vital for the core functionality of this toy. The other attributes do not prevent function if removed or changed. Conclusion: 1 hard constraint.\",\n  \"hard_constraints\": [\"Robot-to-Truck Conversion\"]\n}\n```"
