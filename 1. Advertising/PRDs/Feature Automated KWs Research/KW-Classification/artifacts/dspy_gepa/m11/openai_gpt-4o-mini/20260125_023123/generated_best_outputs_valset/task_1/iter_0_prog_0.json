Size '15\\\" x 10\\\"': Removing it would mean the tray doesn't exist as specified, but another size could still serve food - NOT hard constraint. 2. Natural Bamboo: Tray could be made from other materials (like plastic) and still serve its purpose - NOT hard constraint. 3. Ergonomic Handles: Removing handles may make it less convenient to carry, but doesn't disable its core function of serving - NOT hard constraint. 4. Lightweight: A heavier tray can still serve food/drink efficiently - NOT hard constraint. 5. Eco-Friendly: While this is a positive attribute, it is not essential for the tray's serving capability - NOT hard constraint. 6. Raised Edges: Removing raised edges may increase risk of spillage, but the tray can still function without them - NOT hard constraint. Conclusion: There are NO hard constraints for this product.\",\n  \"hard_constraints\": []\n}\n```"
