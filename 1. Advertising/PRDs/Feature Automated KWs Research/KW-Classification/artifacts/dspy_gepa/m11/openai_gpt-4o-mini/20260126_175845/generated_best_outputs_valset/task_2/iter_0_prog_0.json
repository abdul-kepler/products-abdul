YES - would not block cold air, thus unable to keep warm. MECHANISM. HARD CONSTRAINT. Water-Resistant: Remove entirely? If absent, could still keep warmth, but may not protect against moisture. This is not a HARD constraint. Insulated: Remove entirely? YES - without insulation, it wouldn't provide warmth. MECHANISM. HARD CONSTRAINT. Packable: Remove entirely? Jacket would still function in terms of warmth even if not packable. This is a CONVENIENCE feature, so NOT hard. Lightweight: Remove entirely? Jacket's core function doesn't depend on it being lightweight. NOT hard. Conclusion: 2 hard constraints - Windproof and Insulated.\",\n  \"hard_constraints\": [\"Windproof\", \"Insulated\"]\n}\n```"
