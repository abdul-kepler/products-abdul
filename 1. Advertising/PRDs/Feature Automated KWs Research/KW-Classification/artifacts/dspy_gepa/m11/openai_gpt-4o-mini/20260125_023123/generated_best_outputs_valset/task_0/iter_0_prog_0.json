YES - without heat resistance, hands will burn. It is the MECHANISM that provides protection from heat. HARD CONSTRAINT. Waterproof Silicone: Still protects hands without it, as the main function is heat protection, not water resistance. Hence, it is a QUALITY feature. NOT hard. Slip-Resistant Grip: While it helps with handling, removing it does not prevent the mitt from fulfilling its core function of heat protection. It is a CONVENIENCE feature. NOT hard. Remaining descriptors such as '2-Pack', 'size', 'color', and 'cotton lining' do not impact the product's ability to provide heat protection. Conclusion: 1 hard constraint.\",\n  \"hard_constraints\": [\"Heat Resistant up to 500\u00b0F\"]\n}\n```"
