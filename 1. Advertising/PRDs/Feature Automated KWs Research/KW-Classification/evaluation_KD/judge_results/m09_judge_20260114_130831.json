However, the addition of \"during outdoor activities\" introduces a secondary aspect, implying that the jacket is intended for multiple contexts (outdoor activities), which could encompass various uses such as hiking, skiing, or camping.\n4. The rubric criterion specifies that the output should describe a single core action or function. By including \"outdoor activities,\" the output fails to maintain a singular focus, as it suggests multiple potential uses rather than a unified purpose.\n5.
