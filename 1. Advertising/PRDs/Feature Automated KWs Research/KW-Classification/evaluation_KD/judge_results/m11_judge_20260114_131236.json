However, the module fails to explicitly state that the heat resistance must be up to 500\u00b0F to be considered a hard constraint, which is a necessary detail.\n\n3. The module further evaluates \"Waterproof Silicone\" and \"Slip-Resistant Grip\" as not hard constraints, which is correct. These features enhance usability but are not essential for the mitt's primary function of heat protection.\n\n4. The expected output correctly identifies \"Heat Resistant up to 500\u00b0F\" as the hard constraint, emphasizing the specific temperature limit that is crucial for the product's compatibility and safety.\n\n5.

The listing specifies that the oven mitts are heat resistant up to 500\u00b0F, which is a specific and verifiable constraint related to the product's use case of providing heat protection when cooking.\n2. However, the module output fails to include the full constraint as stated in the product listing, which is \"Heat Resistant up to 500\u00b0F.\" Instead, it simplifies it to just \"Heat Resistant,\" which does not fully capture the specific detail provided in the listing.\n3. The module output also incorrectly categorizes other features such as \"Waterproof Silicone\" and \"Slip-Resistant Grip\" as not being hard constraints. While these features may not be essential for heat protection, they are still relevant to the product's overall functionality and usability. However, the primary focus here is on the identification of hard constraints.\n4. The expected output correctly identifies the hard constraint as \"Heat Resistant up to 500\u00b0F,\" which is specific to the product and traceable to the listing data. The module output's omission of the temperature detail makes it less precise.\n\n**Verdict:** FAIL",

According to the rubric, a product should have 0-1 hard constraints to pass. The module output lists one hard constraint, which is within the acceptable range.\n4. However, the evaluation of \"Ergonomic Handles\" as a hard constraint raises a concern. While it is true that handles enhance usability, the product could still function as a serving tray without them, which suggests that this attribute may not be truly non-negotiable.\n5. The rubric specifies that only truly non-negotiable attributes should be listed as hard constraints. Since the module output does not provide a strong justification for why \"Ergonomic Handles\" is essential, it could be argued that this is a soft preference rather than a hard constraint.\n\nGiven these points, the output does not fully align with the rubric's expectations regarding what constitutes a hard constraint.\n\n**Verdict:** FAIL",
