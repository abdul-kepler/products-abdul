The keyword \"waterproof down jacket men\" also indicates a focus on jackets suitable for cold weather, specifically highlighting waterproof features.\n2. The module output states that the primary use is the same, confirming that both the ASIN (the jacket described) and the keyword (the search term) refer to jackets designed for cold weather protection.\n3. The reasoning provided in the module output explains that the keyword's specification of \"waterproof\" is an enhancement of the existing product type rather than a different product type. This aligns with the PASS conditions of the rubric, as it indicates that the module is handling a same product type case.\n4. The classification of \"R\" (relevant) further supports that the module has correctly identified the relationship between the input and the product type.\n\n**Verdict:** PASS",

The module output states that both the packable rain jacket and the puffer jacket serve the primary purpose of providing warmth and protection from cold and wet weather. However, the focus on the puffer jacket indicates a mismatch in product type since the input is specifically about a rain jacket.\n4. The module output does not correctly handle the same product type scenario, as it compares a rain jacket with a puffer jacket, which are fundamentally different in their primary functions and intended use cases.\n5.

However, the input keyword indicates a different product type (rain jacket) compared to the puffer jacket.\n3. According to the rubric, the module should only handle cases of the same product type.
