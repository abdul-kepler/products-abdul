The module output states that the product does not violate any constraints (`\"violates_constraint\": false`), which indicates that the product meets the specified requirements.\n2. The hard constraint provided is `\"Medium (Size)\"`, which is a specific size requirement for the product.\n3. The product attributes confirm that the size of the jacket is indeed \"Medium\", which aligns with the hard constraint.\n4. The module output does not explicitly explain why there is no violation, but it correctly concludes that there is no violation based on the provided attributes.\n5. However, the reasoning lacks a clear explanation connecting the constraint to the keyword and does not articulate why the violation does not occur. It simply states the conclusion without elaboration.\n\nGiven that the reasoning does not fully meet the PASS conditions due to the lack of a clear explanation, it fails to adequately justify the conclusion.\n\n**Verdict:** FAIL",
