However, it states that they do not have a direct functional relationship and are not typically purchased or used together.\n2. According to the rubric, for a \"PASS,\" the products must be commonly used or purchased together. The module's reasoning suggests that while both items are related to cold weather, they serve different purposes and are not commonly paired.\n3. The expected output indicates a classification of \"C,\" which implies that the two products are complementary and often used together. However, the module output contradicts this by classifying the relationship as \"N\" (not complementary).\n4. The reasoning provided by the module aligns with the \"FAIL conditions\" of the rubric, as it states that the products do not have a direct functional relationship and are not typically used together, which leads to a classification of \"N.\"\n\n**Verdict:** FAIL",

The classification is marked as \"C,\" suggesting that the products are complementary, which is consistent with the provided reasoning.\n3. The relationship described in the output states that the sink faucet is used with the sink caddy organizer to maintain a tidy and functional sink area. This is a valid point, as the caddy organizer is designed to hold items that are typically used in conjunction with a sink faucet.\n4. The reasoning further elaborates that both items are essential components of a kitchen sink setup, which reinforces the idea that they are complementary products.\n5. However, the expected output indicates a relevancy of \"N,\" which suggests that the relationship may not be considered significant enough to warrant a \"C\" classification. This could imply that while they are used together, the connection may be seen as too obvious or not sufficiently complementary in a meaningful way.\n\nGiven the discrepancy between the module output and the expected output, it appears that the module has classified the relationship as complementary when it may not meet the expected standard of significance.\n\n**Verdict:** FAIL",
