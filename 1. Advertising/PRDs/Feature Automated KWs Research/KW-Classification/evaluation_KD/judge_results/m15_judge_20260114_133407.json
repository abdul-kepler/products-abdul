This suggests that the module is treating the water bottle and the travel mug as interchangeable based on their primary function of carrying drinks for hydration.\n3. According to the rubric criterion \"Different Type Only,\" the module should only handle cases where the input is for different product types. However, the module output indicates that it considers the water bottle and travel mug to serve the same primary function, which implies that it is processing a same product type case rather than a different product type case.\n4. The reasoning provided in the module output does not support the requirement of handling different product types, as it concludes that both products serve the same purpose, which is contrary to the expected handling of different product types.\n\n**Verdict:** FAIL",
