According to the rubric criterion, own brand terms should never trigger a CB classification.

However, the keyword \"le creuset\" is indeed an own brand term that is being classified as a competitor brand, which violates the rubric's PASS conditions.\n5.

There are no partial or substring matches involved in this evaluation, as \"le creuset\" and \"Le Creuset\" are considered the same phrase when accounting for case sensitivity.\n6.

In this case, the module incorrectly identifies \"KitchenAid\" as a match when it is not present in the keyword.\n4.
