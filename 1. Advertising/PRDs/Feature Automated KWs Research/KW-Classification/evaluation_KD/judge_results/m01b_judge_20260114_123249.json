      "reasoning": "**Reasoning:**\n1. The input data specifies a `brand_name` of \"Frigidaire\" and a `manufacturer` of \"Curtis\".\n2. According to the rubric criterion, the manufacturer should be null if it matches the brand name.\n3. In this case, the manufacturer \"Curtis\" does not match the brand name \"Frigidaire\".\n4. The module output correctly returns the manufacturer as \"Curtis\", which is consistent with the input data.\n5. Since the manufacturer does not match the brand name, the condition for returning null is not applicable here.\n\n**Verdict:** PASS",

      "reasoning": "**Reasoning:**\n1. The criterion states that the `searchable_standards` should be empty unless customers actively search for a standard by name.\n2. The module output shows that the `searchable_standards` array is empty, which aligns with the PASS condition for most products.\n3. There are no brand-like standards included in the `searchable_standards`, which would also be acceptable if they were present.\n4. The output does not contain any technical standards (e.g., ENFit, USB-C, Bluetooth) that would lead to a FAIL condition.\n5. Since the `searchable_standards` is indeed empty and does not include any standards that customers typically do not search for by name, it meets the criteria for a PASS.\n\n**Verdict:** PASS",
