In-Ear: DESIGN choice - over-ear headphones also play audio. Basic earbuds don't need in-ear design. NOT hard constraint.\n\n2. Deep Bass Sound: QUALITY modifier (NEVER category) - regular sound without enhanced bass still plays audio. Basic earbuds work without deep bass. NOT hard constraint.\n\n3. Bluetooth 5.2: VERSION specification (NEVER category) - Bluetooth 4.0 still transmits audio. Basic wireless earbuds use older Bluetooth versions. NOT hard constraint.\n\n4. Up to 32 Hours Battery Life: PERFORMANCE specification (NEVER category) - 2-hour battery still plays audio. Basic earbuds have much shorter battery life. NOT hard constraint.\n\n5. Speed Charging: CONVENIENCE feature - slow charging still allows audio playback. Basic earbuds don't have speed charging. NOT hard constraint.\n\n6. Water and Dust Resistant: DURABILITY feature (NEVER category) - earbuds still play audio when dry and clean. Basic earbuds aren't water/dust resistant. NOT hard constraint.\n\n7. Hands-Free Call with VoiceAware: FEATURE addition - core function is audio listening, not calling. Basic earbuds work without this feature. NOT hard constraint.\n\n8. White: COLOR choice - any color earbuds play audio equally. NOT hard constraint.\n\nAll attributes are either QUALITY modifiers, PERFORMANCE specs, DURABILITY features, or CONVENIENCE additions. None are MECHANISMS required for the core function of playing audio. A basic $1 pair of earbuds can perform the validated use without any of these attributes.\n\nConclusion: 0 hard constraints."

Double-Wall Insulation: QUALITY modifier - keeps drinks cold longer, but non-insulated bottles still carry drinks for hydration. Basic $1 water bottles exist without insulation. NEVER category.\n\n3. Stainless Steel: MATERIAL choice - plastic bottles also carry drinks for hydration. Basic water bottles are often plastic. NEVER category.\n\n4. 24 Ounce: SIZE specification - any size bottle (8oz, 16oz, 32oz) still carries drinks. SIZE is NEVER a hard constraint.\n\n5. Denim (Color): AESTHETIC choice - color has no impact on carrying drinks for hydration. NEVER category.\n\n6. BPA-Free: SAFETY feature - bottles with BPA still physically carry drinks for hydration. Basic bottles may not advertise BPA-free. NEVER category.\n\n7. FreeSip Spout: FEATURE design - bottles with regular caps/spouts still carry drinks. This is a convenience/design feature, not a functional requirement. Basic bottles have simple caps.\n\nAll attributes fall into NEVER categories (QUALITY, MATERIAL, PERFORMANCE, SAFETY, AESTHETIC). A basic $1 plastic water bottle with a simple cap performs the core function of 'carrying drinks for hydration' without any of these attributes. This follows the 99% rule - water bottles are a classic example of products with 0 hard constraints."

        "reasoning": "Analyzing Kitchen Sink Caddy Organizer for 'Kitchen sink item organization'. Let me apply the 3-step test to each attribute:\n\n1. 304 Stainless Steel: MATERIAL choice - plastic organizers also hold kitchen items. Basic $1 organizers are often plastic. This is MATERIAL (NEVER category). NOT a hard constraint.\n\n2. Rustproof: DURABILITY feature - organizer still holds items even if it rusts over time. This is DURABILITY (NEVER category). NOT a hard constraint.\n\n3. Automatic Drainage System: QUALITY feature - organizer still holds and organizes items without drainage, just requires more cleaning. Basic organizers often lack drainage. This is QUALITY improvement. NOT a hard constraint.\n\n4. Premium Sturdy Material: QUALITY marker - less sturdy organizers still hold items. This is explicitly in QUALITY (NEVER category). NOT a hard constraint.\n\n5. Reasonable Divider Design: QUALITY feature - even a single compartment organizer still organizes items. Basic organizers may have fewer or no dividers. This is QUALITY. NOT a hard constraint.\n\n6. High Brush Holder/Sponge Holder variants: These are FEATURE variations - the core function of organizing sink items works with any compartment configuration. NOT hard constraints.\n\nApplying the \"Basic Product\" check: A basic $1 sink organizer (plastic, no drainage, simple design) still performs the core function of organizing kitchen sink items. All the listed attributes are quality improvements, not mechanisms required for function.\n\nConclusion: 0 hard constraints. This follows the 99% rule - basic organizers exist and function without any of these premium features.\""

PERFORMANCE modifier.\n- Waterproof: Without waterproof, eyeliner still draws lines when dry. DURABILITY (NEVER category).\n- Smudge-Proof: Without smudge-proof, eyeliner still draws lines - just smudges more. QUALITY modifier.\n- Built-in Sharpener: Without built-in sharpener, pencil still draws lines (can use external sharpener). CONVENIENCE feature.\n- Built-in Smudger: Without built-in smudger, pencil still draws lines. CONVENIENCE feature.\n- Black Brown Color: Any color still draws lines. COLOR choice.\n- Matte Finish: Glossy finish still draws lines. FINISH choice.\n\nStep 2: Mechanism vs Quality Filter:\nAll attributes are QUALITY modifiers, PERFORMANCE specs, or CONVENIENCE features - none are the core MECHANISM that enables line drawing.\n\nStep 3: Basic Product Check:\nA basic $1 eyeliner pencil can draw lines around eyes without any of these premium features (24hr wear, waterproof, built-in tools, etc.).\n\nThe core function 'drawing lines around eyes' requires only pigment that can mark the skin - all other attributes are quality/performance enhancements.\n\nConclusion: 0 hard constraints."

        "reasoning": "Analyzing Transformers Optimus Prime figure for 'Action figure play'. Let me apply the 3-step test to each attribute:\n\n11-inch Scale: Step 1 - A smaller or larger figure can still be played with as an action figure. Step 2 - This is SIZE/QUALITY, not mechanism. Step 3 - Basic action figures come in various sizes. NOT a hard constraint.\n\nRobot-to-Truck Conversion: Step 1 - Without conversion ability, this would just be a static robot figure, but it could still function for action figure play (posing, imaginative scenarios). Step 2 - This is a FEATURE that enhances play but isn't the core mechanism. Step 3 - Basic action figures exist without transformation ability. NOT a hard constraint.\n\n6-Step Conversion: Step 1 - The figure could convert in more or fewer steps and still transform. Step 2 - This is COMPLEXITY/QUALITY of the conversion process. Step 3 - Basic transforming toys have varying step counts. NOT a hard constraint.\n\nCyber Commander Series: Step 1 - This is just a product line designation, doesn't affect core function. Step 2 - This is BRANDING/SERIES. Step 3 - Basic action figures aren't part of specific series. NOT a hard constraint.\n\nOptimus Prime Character: Step 1 - The figure could represent any character and still function as an action figure. Step 2 - This is CHARACTER/THEME choice. Step 3 - Basic action figures can be generic characters. NOT a hard constraint.\n\nAll attributes are either QUALITY modifiers, FEATURES, or BRANDING elements. None are fundamental MECHANISMS required for basic action figure play. A basic $1 action figure without any of these attributes would still function for imaginative play."
