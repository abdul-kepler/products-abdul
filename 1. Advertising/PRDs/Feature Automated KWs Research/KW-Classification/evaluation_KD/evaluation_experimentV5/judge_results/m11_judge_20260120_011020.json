Deep Bass Sound: If removed, the earbuds would still produce sound, just not with enhanced bass - QUALITY, NOT hard constraint. 3. Up to 32 Hours Battery Life: If removed, the earbuds would still function with a shorter battery life (e.g., 8 hours) - PERFORMANCE SPEC, NOT hard constraint. 4. Water and Dust Resistant: If removed, the earbuds would still function and produce sound, just not be protected from water and dust - DURABILITY feature, NOT hard constraint. 5. Hands-Free Call with VoiceAware: If removed, the earbuds would still allow for hands-free calls, just without the VoiceAware feature - CONVENIENCE feature, NOT hard constraint. Conclusion: 0 hard constraints."
