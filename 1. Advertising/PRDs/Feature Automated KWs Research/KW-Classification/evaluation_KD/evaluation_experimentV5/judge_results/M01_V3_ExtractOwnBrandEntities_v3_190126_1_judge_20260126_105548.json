          "content": "# Task: ExtractOwnBrandEntities\n\nYou are an Amazon PPC specialist extracting brand entities from product listings.\n\n## Core Concept: Brand Entity vs Product Word\n\n**Brand Entity** = WHO makes this? (trademark, company name)\n**Product Word** = WHAT is this? (thing you can buy)\n\n### The Amazon Test\n\nFor each word, ask: **\"Can I search Amazon and buy a [word] as a standalone product?\"**\n\n- \"wallet\" \u2192 Yes, you can buy a wallet \u2192 **PRODUCT WORD** \u2192 exclude\n- \"bottle\" \u2192 Yes, you can buy a bottle \u2192 **PRODUCT WORD** \u2192 exclude\n- \"kitchen\" \u2192 Yes, you can buy kitchen items \u2192 **PRODUCT WORD** \u2192 exclude\n- \"bread\" \u2192 Yes, you can buy bread \u2192 **PRODUCT WORD** \u2192 exclude\n- \"Anker\" \u2192 No, Anker is a brand name \u2192 **BRAND ENTITY** \u2192 include\n- \"PowerIQ\" \u2192 No, it's a trademarked product line \u2192 **BRAND ENTITY** \u2192 include\n\n### \ud83d\udd34 CRITICAL: Apply Amazon Test to EVERY word in multi-word entities\n\nWhen you have a sub-brand like \"[Brand] [SubBrand]\", you MUST test EACH word:\n\n1. Test \"[SubBrand]\" alone: Can you buy a \"[SubBrand]\" on Amazon?\n   - If \"[SubBrand]\" is a common word \u2192 **REMOVE the entire entity**\n   - If \"[SubBrand]\" is ONLY used as this brand's trademark \u2192 **KEEP**\n\n**Common words that FAIL the Amazon Test when used in sub-brands:**\n- beam, wave, pro, max, plus, ultra \u2192 generic product modifiers\n- bass, sound, audio, noise \u2192 audio/electronics terms\n- fresh, pure, clean, clear \u2192 descriptive adjectives\n- sport, active, fit, flex \u2192 lifestyle terms\n\n**Rule: If the last word of a sub-brand is a dictionary word with meaning outside this brand, EXCLUDE the entire sub-brand entity.**\n\n**Examples:**\n| Sub-brand | Last Word Test | Decision |\n|-----------|---------------|----------|\n| `Bose Deep Bass` | \"bass\" = audio term | \u274c REMOVE |\n| `Bose Sound Pro` | \"pro\" = generic modifier | \u274c REMOVE |\n| `Anker PowerIQ` | \"PowerIQ\" = unique trademark | \u2705 KEEP |\n| `ColorStay` | unique trademark | \u2705 KEEP |\n\n### \ud83d\udeab DO NOT Extract Partial Sub-Brands\n\n**When a multi-word sub-brand fails the Amazon Test, skip the ENTIRE concept:**\n\n\u274c **WRONG approach:**\n1. See \"Sound Pro\" in title\n2. Test \u2192 \"pro\" is generic \u2192 reject \"Sound Pro\"\n3. Think \"maybe Sound alone is valid\" \u2192 extract \"Sound\" \u2190 **WRONG!**\n\n\u2705 **CORRECT approach:**\n1. See \"Sound Pro\" in title\n2. Test \u2192 \"pro\" is generic \u2192 reject ENTIRE \"Sound Pro\" concept\n3. Do NOT extract \"Sound\" separately\n4. Only extract the main brand (e.g., \"Bose\")\n\n**Why?** If \"Word1 Word2\" was meant as a product line name, extracting just \"Word1\" loses the trademark context. \"Sound\" alone is generic and meaningless without \"Pro\".\n\n### Critical Rule\n\n**If your entity is [Brand] + [Product Word], ONLY keep the brand part.**\n\nExamples:\n- `Bellroy Wallet` \u2192 \"wallet\" passes Amazon test \u2192 keep only `Bellroy`\n- `Pyrex Kitchen` \u2192 \"kitchen\" passes Amazon test \u2192 keep only `Pyrex`\n- `PowerIQ Charger` \u2192 \"charger\" passes Amazon test \u2192 keep only `PowerIQ`\n\n## Inputs\n\n- **brand_name**: JBL\n- **title**: JBL Vibe Beam - True Wireless JBL Deep Bass Sound Earbuds, Bluetooth 5.2, Water & Dust Resistant, Hands-free call with VoiceAware, Up to 32 hours of battery life (White)\n- **bullet_points**: JBL Deep Bass Sound: Get the most from your mixes with high-quality audio from secure, reliable earbuds with 8mm drivers featuring JBL Deep Bass Sound\nComfortable fit: The ergonomic, stick-closed design of the JBL Vibe Beam fits so comfortably you may forget you're wearing them. The closed design excludes external sounds, enhancing the bass performance\nUp to 32 (8h + 24h) hours of battery life and speed charging: With 8 hours of battery life in the earbuds and 24 in the case, the JBL Vibe Beam provide all-day audio. When you need more power, you can speed charge an extra two hours in just 10 minutes.\nHands-free calls with VoiceAware: When you're making hands-free stereo calls on the go, VoiceAware lets you balance how much of your own voice you hear while talking with others\nWater and dust resistant: From the beach to the bike trail, the IP54-certified earbuds and IPX2 charging case are water and dust resistant for all-day experiences\n- **description**: \"Bring your sound everywhere.

Generate **EXACTLY 1** case variant (lowercase) - no more!\n2. Generate **3-5 DIFFERENT** spelling/phonetic typos\n3. Each typo must be **UNIQUE** - check before adding\n4. Focus on mistakes real customers make when typing fast\n\n**Example typo generation (following priority):**\n- Brand \"Bellroy\" \u2192 `Bellroy`, `bellroy`(case), `Belroy`(missing), `Bellory`(swap), `Bellray`(vowel)\n- Brand \"Pyrex\" \u2192 `Pyrex`, `pyrex`(case), `Prex`(missing), `Pirex`(phonetic), `Pyerx`(swap)\n- Brand \"Bose\" \u2192 `Bose`, `bose`(case), `Bsoe`(swap), `Bosee`(doubled)\n\n### \ud83d\udd34 ANTI-HALLUCINATION CONSTRAINT (CRITICAL)\n\n**Each typo must be traceable to EXACTLY ONE edit operation from the original brand.**\n\nValid single-edit operations:\n1. **Double ONE existing letter**: Pyrex \u2192 Pyrrex (doubled 'r')\n2. **Drop ONE letter**: Pyrex \u2192 Prex (dropped 'y')\n3. **Swap TWO adjacent letters**: Pyrex \u2192 Pyerx (swapped 're')\n4. **Replace with keyboard-adjacent key**: Pyrex \u2192 Pytex (r\u2192t adjacent)\n5. **Replace with phonetically similar**: Pyrex \u2192 Pirex (y\u2192i similar sound)\n\n**\ud83d\udeab FORBIDDEN (These are HALLUCINATIONS):**\n- Adding letters not in original AND not keyboard-adjacent: Pyrex \u2192 Pyrexx \u274c (extra 'x' not justified)\n- Multiple simultaneous edits: Pyrex \u2192 Prx \u274c (two letters removed)\n- Inventing new letter combinations: Bellroy \u2192 Bellrizza \u274c\n- Any output not derivable from brand_name input\n\n**VALIDATION: Before outputting each typo, ask: \"Can I explain this typo with ONE edit rule?\"**\n- If YES \u2192 Keep it\n- If NO \u2192 It's a hallucination \u2192 REMOVE IT\n\n### Step 3: Validate Each Entity (Amazon Test)\nBefore adding to output, check: \"Can I buy [last word] on Amazon?\"\n- If YES \u2192 REMOVE (it's a product word)\n- If NO \u2192 KEEP (it's a brand)\n\n**EXCLUDE:**\n- Any word that passes the Amazon test (products you can buy)\n- Features (wireless, waterproof, slim, RFID)\n- Any [Brand] + [product noun] combination\n\n## Validation Process (MANDATORY)\n\n**For EACH candidate entity, do this check BEFORE adding to output:**\n\n### Step 1: Split entity into words\n`Bose Deep Bass` \u2192 [\"Bose\", \"Deep\", \"Bass\"]\n\n### Step 2: Check the LAST word\nAsk: \"Is [last word] something I can buy, use, or a feature?\"\n\n### Step 3: Decide\n- **If last word is a product/feature** \u2192 REMOVE entire entity\n- **If last word is only the brand name or typo** \u2192 KEEP\n\n### Common product words (things you can buy/use):\ntoys, figure, earbuds, speaker, bass, sound, bottle, wallet, holder, bag, case, organizer, kitchen, bread\n\n### Common features (describe the product):\nwireless, waterproof, deep, slim, RFID, insulated, stainless\n\n### Examples of the Amazon Test in Action\n\n| Entity | Last Word | Amazon Test | Result |\n|--------|-----------|-------------|--------|\n| `Bellroy Wallet` | wallet | Can buy wallets \u2713 | REMOVE |\n| `Transformers Toys` | toys | Can buy toys \u2713 | REMOVE |\n| `Bose Earbuds` | earbuds | Can buy earbuds \u2713 | REMOVE |\n| `Pyrex Kitchen` | kitchen | Can buy kitchen items \u2713 | REMOVE |\n| `Zojirushi Bread` | bread | Can buy bread \u2713 | REMOVE |\n| `Bose Deep Bass` | bass | \"bass\" is audio feature | REMOVE |\n| `Bellroy` | Bellroy | Can't buy \"Bellroy\" alone | KEEP |\n| `PowerIQ` | PowerIQ | Trademarked name | KEEP |\n| `ColorStay` | ColorStay | Trademarked name | KEEP |\n\n## Output Format\n\nOutput validated brand entities with typos (max 10):\n\n```json\n{\"brand_entities\": [\"Brand\", \"brand\", \"Brnad\", \"Bradn\", \"Brandd\", \"SubBrand\", ...]}\n```\n\n**CRITICAL: Each entity must be UNIQUE - no duplicates allowed!**\n\n**Expected output structure:**\n- Original brand name + 3-5 typos (all unique)\n- Lowercase variation (exactly 1)\n- Sub-brand if exists + its typos\n- Manufacturer if different from brand + its typos\n\n### Complete Example\n\n**Input:**\n- brand_name: \"Anker\"\n- manufacturer: \"Belkin\"\n- title: \"Anker PowerIQ Fast Charging USB Wall Charger...\"\n\n**Expected Output:**\n```json\n{\n  \"brand_entities\": [\n    \"Anker\",\n    \"anker\",\n    \"Ankr\",\n    \"Akner\",\n    \"Annker\",\n    \"PowerIQ\",\n    \"poweriq\",\n    \"PwerIQ\",\n    \"Belkin\",\n    \"belkin\"\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n**Why these entities:**\n- `Anker` + 4 typos (lowercase, missing letter, swap, doubled)\n- `PowerIQ` + 2 typos (trademarked sub-brand)\n- `Belkin` + 1 typo (manufacturer, different from brand)\n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\udd34 THINK OF YOUR OUTPUT AS A SET\n\n**Mathematical set = NO DUPLICATES ALLOWED**\n\nYour output array is a **SET**, not a list. In sets, each element can appear only ONCE.\n\nBefore outputting, verify your set is valid:\n- Set `{\"Anker\", \"anker\", \"Annker\", \"Ankr\"}` \u2713 **VALID** - all unique strings\n- Set `{\"Anker\", \"anker\", \"Anker\", \"Ankr\"}` \u2717 **INVALID** - \"Anker\" appears twice\n\n**VALIDATION RULE: If you see ANY string twice in your output, your output is INVALID and you must remove the duplicate.**\n\nMental check process:\n1. Write your list\n2. For EACH string, ask: \"Have I already written this exact string?\"\n3. If YES \u2192 DELETE IT (keep only the first occurrence)\n4. If NO \u2192 Keep it\n\n---\n\n## STOP! Before outputting, verify:\n\n1. **NO DUPLICATES** - Scan your list: if any entity appears more than once, REMOVE the duplicate\n2. **No entity ends with a product word** (toys, figure, earbuds, bass, bottle, wallet, etc.)\n3. **No entity ends with a feature** (wireless, deep, slim, RFID)\n4. **No concatenated forms** (BoseSoundProEarbuds \u2192 wrong, use \"Bose\" and \"Sound Pro\" separately)\n5. **Max 1-2 words per entity** (except known trademarks like \"The North Face\")\n\n**DUPLICATE CHECK (MANDATORY):**\nBefore returning, mentally scan: \"Is 'X' already in my list?\" for EACH entity you add.\nExample BAD output: `[\"Bose\", \"bose\", \"Bose\", \"Sound\"]` - \"Bose\" appears twice \u2192 REMOVE one\n\n## Quick Reference\n\n**Always remove if last word is a common noun like:**\n- Things you wear/carry: wallet, bag, case, holder, jacket, shoes\n- Kitchen items: bottle, organizer, caddy, tray, maker\n- Electronics: phone, earbuds, speaker, charger\n- Food: bread, snacks, drinks\n- Any physical product category\n\n**Always keep:**\n- Brand names: Bellroy, Pyrex, Anker, Bose\n- Typos of brand names: Bellroyy, Annker, Bsoe\n- Trademarked product lines: PowerIQ, ColorStay\n\n---\n\n## FINAL CHECK: Remove any duplicates from your output array before returning!\n",

Test \"[SubBrand]\" alone: Can you buy a \"[SubBrand]\" on Amazon?\n   - If \"[SubBrand]\" is a common word \u2192 **REMOVE the entire entity**\n   - If \"[SubBrand]\" is ONLY used as this brand's trademark \u2192 **KEEP**\n\n**Common words that FAIL the Amazon Test when used in sub-brands:**\n- beam, wave, pro, max, plus, ultra \u2192 generic product modifiers\n- bass, sound, audio, noise \u2192 audio/electronics terms\n- fresh, pure, clean, clear \u2192 descriptive adjectives\n- sport, active, fit, flex \u2192 lifestyle terms\n\n**Rule: If the last word of a sub-brand is a dictionary word with meaning outside this brand, EXCLUDE the entire sub-brand entity.**\n\n**Examples:**\n| Sub-brand | Last Word Test | Decision |\n|-----------|---------------|----------|\n| `Bose Deep Bass` | \"bass\" = audio term | \u274c REMOVE |\n| `Bose Sound Pro` | \"pro\" = generic modifier | \u274c REMOVE |\n| `Anker PowerIQ` | \"PowerIQ\" = unique trademark | \u2705 KEEP |\n| `ColorStay` | unique trademark | \u2705 KEEP |\n\n### \ud83d\udeab DO NOT Extract Partial Sub-Brands\n\n**When a multi-word sub-brand fails the Amazon Test, skip the ENTIRE concept:**\n\n\u274c **WRONG approach:**\n1.

(trademark, company name)\n**Product Word** = WHAT is this? (thing you can buy)\n\n### The Amazon Test\n\nFor each word, ask: **\"Can I search Amazon and buy a [word] as a standalone product?\"**\n\n- \"wallet\" \u2192 Yes, you can buy a wallet \u2192 **PRODUCT WORD** \u2192 exclude\n- \"bottle\" \u2192 Yes, you can buy a bottle \u2192 **PRODUCT WORD** \u2192 exclude\n- \"kitchen\" \u2192 Yes, you can buy kitchen items \u2192 **PRODUCT WORD** \u2192 exclude\n- \"bread\" \u2192 Yes, you can buy bread \u2192 **PRODUCT WORD** \u2192 exclude\n- \"Anker\" \u2192 No, Anker is a brand name \u2192 **BRAND ENTITY** \u2192 include\n- \"PowerIQ\" \u2192 No, it's a trademarked product line \u2192 **BRAND ENTITY** \u2192 include\n\n### \ud83d\udd34 CRITICAL: Apply Amazon Test to EVERY word in multi-word entities\n\nWhen you have a sub-brand like \"[Brand] [SubBrand]\", you MUST test EACH word:\n\n1. Test \"[SubBrand]\" alone: Can you buy a \"[SubBrand]\" on Amazon?\n   - If \"[SubBrand]\" is a common word \u2192 **REMOVE the entire entity**\n   - If \"[SubBrand]\" is ONLY used as this brand's trademark \u2192 **KEEP**\n\n**Common words that FAIL the Amazon Test when used in sub-brands:**\n- beam, wave, pro, max, plus, ultra \u2192 generic product modifiers\n- bass, sound, audio, noise \u2192 audio/electronics terms\n- fresh, pure, clean, clear \u2192 descriptive adjectives\n- sport, active, fit, flex \u2192 lifestyle terms\n\n**Rule: If the last word of a sub-brand is a dictionary word with meaning outside this brand, EXCLUDE the entire sub-brand entity.**\n\n**Examples:**\n| Sub-brand | Last Word Test | Decision |\n|-----------|---------------|----------|\n| `Bose Deep Bass` | \"bass\" = audio term | \u274c REMOVE |\n| `Bose Sound Pro` | \"pro\" = generic modifier | \u274c REMOVE |\n| `Anker PowerIQ` | \"PowerIQ\" = unique trademark | \u2705 KEEP |\n| `ColorStay` | unique trademark | \u2705 KEEP |\n\n### \ud83d\udeab DO NOT Extract Partial Sub-Brands\n\n**When a multi-word sub-brand fails the Amazon Test, skip the ENTIRE concept:**\n\n\u274c **WRONG approach:**\n1.

Think \"maybe Sound alone is valid\" \u2192 extract \"Sound\" \u2190 **WRONG!**\n\n\u2705 **CORRECT approach:**\n1. See \"Sound Pro\" in title\n2. Test \u2192 \"pro\" is generic \u2192 reject ENTIRE \"Sound Pro\" concept\n3. Do NOT extract \"Sound\" separately\n4. Only extract the main brand (e.g., \"Bose\")\n\n**Why?** If \"Word1 Word2\" was meant as a product line name, extracting just \"Word1\" loses the trademark context. \"Sound\" alone is generic and meaningless without \"Pro\".\n\n### Critical Rule\n\n**If your entity is [Brand] + [Product Word], ONLY keep the brand part.**\n\nExamples:\n- `Bellroy Wallet` \u2192 \"wallet\" passes Amazon test \u2192 keep only `Bellroy`\n- `Pyrex Kitchen` \u2192 \"kitchen\" passes Amazon test \u2192 keep only `Pyrex`\n- `PowerIQ Charger` \u2192 \"charger\" passes Amazon test \u2192 keep only `PowerIQ`\n\n## Inputs\n\n- **brand_name**: Cisily\n- **title**: Cisily Kitchen Sink Caddy Organzier with High Brush Holder, Sponge Holder for Sink, 304 Rustproof Stainless, Kitchen Countertop Soap Dispenser Organizer, Kitchen Decor and Accessories\n- **bullet_points**: 304 Stainless Steel\nQuality Control 100%\n\u3010AUTOMATIC DRAINAGE SYSTEM\u3011Cisily adopts slope design to achieve perfect drainage effect, aiming at reducing the frequency and time of cleaning the sponge holder, freeing your hands, reducing the burden on your kitchen work, and improving your happiness index.\n\u3010PREMIUM STURDY MATERIAL\u3011 Cisily kitchen sink organizer is made of premium stainless steel which can effectively prevent rust and deformation.

(trademark, company name)\n**Product Word** = WHAT is this? (thing you can buy)\n\n### The Amazon Test\n\nFor each word, ask: **\"Can I search Amazon and buy a [word] as a standalone product?\"**\n\n- \"wallet\" \u2192 Yes, you can buy a wallet \u2192 **PRODUCT WORD** \u2192 exclude\n- \"bottle\" \u2192 Yes, you can buy a bottle \u2192 **PRODUCT WORD** \u2192 exclude\n- \"kitchen\" \u2192 Yes, you can buy kitchen items \u2192 **PRODUCT WORD** \u2192 exclude\n- \"bread\" \u2192 Yes, you can buy bread \u2192 **PRODUCT WORD** \u2192 exclude\n- \"Anker\" \u2192 No, Anker is a brand name \u2192 **BRAND ENTITY** \u2192 include\n- \"PowerIQ\" \u2192 No, it's a trademarked product line \u2192 **BRAND ENTITY** \u2192 include\n\n### \ud83d\udd34 CRITICAL: Apply Amazon Test to EVERY word in multi-word entities\n\nWhen you have a sub-brand like \"[Brand] [SubBrand]\", you MUST test EACH word:\n\n1. Test \"[SubBrand]\" alone: Can you buy a \"[SubBrand]\" on Amazon?\n   - If \"[SubBrand]\" is a common word \u2192 **REMOVE the entire entity**\n   - If \"[SubBrand]\" is ONLY used as this brand's trademark \u2192 **KEEP**\n\n**Common words that FAIL the Amazon Test when used in sub-brands:**\n- beam, wave, pro, max, plus, ultra \u2192 generic product modifiers\n- bass, sound, audio, noise \u2192 audio/electronics terms\n- fresh, pure, clean, clear \u2192 descriptive adjectives\n- sport, active, fit, flex \u2192 lifestyle terms\n\n**Rule: If the last word of a sub-brand is a dictionary word with meaning outside this brand, EXCLUDE the entire sub-brand entity.**\n\n**Examples:**\n| Sub-brand | Last Word Test | Decision |\n|-----------|---------------|----------|\n| `Bose Deep Bass` | \"bass\" = audio term | \u274c REMOVE |\n| `Bose Sound Pro` | \"pro\" = generic modifier | \u274c REMOVE |\n| `Anker PowerIQ` | \"PowerIQ\" = unique trademark | \u2705 KEEP |\n| `ColorStay` | unique trademark | \u2705 KEEP |\n\n### \ud83d\udeab DO NOT Extract Partial Sub-Brands\n\n**When a multi-word sub-brand fails the Amazon Test, skip the ENTIRE concept:**\n\n\u274c **WRONG approach:**\n1.

Think \"maybe Sound alone is valid\" \u2192 extract \"Sound\" \u2190 **WRONG!**\n\n\u2705 **CORRECT approach:**\n1. See \"Sound Pro\" in title\n2. Test \u2192 \"pro\" is generic \u2192 reject ENTIRE \"Sound Pro\" concept\n3. Do NOT extract \"Sound\" separately\n4. Only extract the main brand (e.g., \"Bose\")\n\n**Why?** If \"Word1 Word2\" was meant as a product line name, extracting just \"Word1\" loses the trademark context. \"Sound\" alone is generic and meaningless without \"Pro\".\n\n### Critical Rule\n\n**If your entity is [Brand] + [Product Word], ONLY keep the brand part.**\n\nExamples:\n- `Bellroy Wallet` \u2192 \"wallet\" passes Amazon test \u2192 keep only `Bellroy`\n- `Pyrex Kitchen` \u2192 \"kitchen\" passes Amazon test \u2192 keep only `Pyrex`\n- `PowerIQ Charger` \u2192 \"charger\" passes Amazon test \u2192 keep only `PowerIQ`\n\n## Inputs\n\n- **brand_name**: Pioneer Camp\n- **title**: Pioneer Camp Mens Lightweight Packable Puffer Jacket Winter Insulated Puffy Coat Water Repellent Warm Quilted Jackets Travel\uff08Black;M\uff09\n- **bullet_points**: WINDPROOF & WARM The stand collar lightweight puffer jacket is made with windproof, soft nylon fabric to block out cold air and keep you warm.

Test \"[SubBrand]\" alone: Can you buy a \"[SubBrand]\" on Amazon?\n   - If \"[SubBrand]\" is a common word \u2192 **REMOVE the entire entity**\n   - If \"[SubBrand]\" is ONLY used as this brand's trademark \u2192 **KEEP**\n\n**Common words that FAIL the Amazon Test when used in sub-brands:**\n- beam, wave, pro, max, plus, ultra \u2192 generic product modifiers\n- bass, sound, audio, noise \u2192 audio/electronics terms\n- fresh, pure, clean, clear \u2192 descriptive adjectives\n- sport, active, fit, flex \u2192 lifestyle terms\n\n**Rule: If the last word of a sub-brand is a dictionary word with meaning outside this brand, EXCLUDE the entire sub-brand entity.**\n\n**Examples:**\n| Sub-brand | Last Word Test | Decision |\n|-----------|---------------|----------|\n| `Bose Deep Bass` | \"bass\" = audio term | \u274c REMOVE |\n| `Bose Sound Pro` | \"pro\" = generic modifier | \u274c REMOVE |\n| `Anker PowerIQ` | \"PowerIQ\" = unique trademark | \u2705 KEEP |\n| `ColorStay` | unique trademark | \u2705 KEEP |\n\n### \ud83d\udeab DO NOT Extract Partial Sub-Brands\n\n**When a multi-word sub-brand fails the Amazon Test, skip the ENTIRE concept:**\n\n\u274c **WRONG approach:**\n1.

Only extract the main brand (e.g., \"Bose\")\n\n**Why?** If \"Word1 Word2\" was meant as a product line name, extracting just \"Word1\" loses the trademark context. \"Sound\" alone is generic and meaningless without \"Pro\".\n\n### Critical Rule\n\n**If your entity is [Brand] + [Product Word], ONLY keep the brand part.**\n\nExamples:\n- `Bellroy Wallet` \u2192 \"wallet\" passes Amazon test \u2192 keep only `Bellroy`\n- `Pyrex Kitchen` \u2192 \"kitchen\" passes Amazon test \u2192 keep only `Pyrex`\n- `PowerIQ Charger` \u2192 \"charger\" passes Amazon test \u2192 keep only `PowerIQ`\n\n## Inputs\n\n- **brand_name**: WEBACOO\n- **title**: Webacoo Bamboo Tray with Handles - Lightweight Serving Tray for Breakfast in Bed, Coffee Table, BBQ, Kitchen, Ottoman & Party - Perfect for Lap, Couch & Gifting - Large Size Wood Tea Tray - 15\u201dx10\u201d\n- **bullet_points**: \ud83c\udf3f Serve with Webacoo Style: Elevate your dining experience!

Focus on mistakes real customers make when typing fast\n\n**Example typo generation (following priority):**\n- Brand \"Bellroy\" \u2192 `Bellroy`, `bellroy`(case), `Belroy`(missing), `Bellory`(swap), `Bellray`(vowel)\n- Brand \"Pyrex\" \u2192 `Pyrex`, `pyrex`(case), `Prex`(missing), `Pirex`(phonetic), `Pyerx`(swap)\n- Brand \"Bose\" \u2192 `Bose`, `bose`(case), `Bsoe`(swap), `Bosee`(doubled)\n\n### \ud83d\udd34 ANTI-HALLUCINATION CONSTRAINT (CRITICAL)\n\n**Each typo must be traceable to EXACTLY ONE edit operation from the original brand.**\n\nValid single-edit operations:\n1. **Double ONE existing letter**: Pyrex \u2192 Pyrrex (doubled 'r')\n2. **Drop ONE letter**: Pyrex \u2192 Prex (dropped 'y')\n3. **Swap TWO adjacent letters**: Pyrex \u2192 Pyerx (swapped 're')\n4. **Replace with keyboard-adjacent key**: Pyrex \u2192 Pytex (r\u2192t adjacent)\n5. **Replace with phonetically similar**: Pyrex \u2192 Pirex (y\u2192i similar sound)\n\n**\ud83d\udeab FORBIDDEN (These are HALLUCINATIONS):**\n- Adding letters not in original AND not keyboard-adjacent: Pyrex \u2192 Pyrexx \u274c (extra 'x' not justified)\n- Multiple simultaneous edits: Pyrex \u2192 Prx \u274c (two letters removed)\n- Inventing new letter combinations: Bellroy \u2192 Bellrizza \u274c\n- Any output not derivable from brand_name input\n\n**VALIDATION: Before outputting each typo, ask: \"Can I explain this typo with ONE edit rule?\"**\n- If YES \u2192 Keep it\n- If NO \u2192 It's a hallucination \u2192 REMOVE IT\n\n### Step 3: Validate Each Entity (Amazon Test)\nBefore adding to output, check: \"Can I buy [last word] on Amazon?\"\n- If YES \u2192 REMOVE (it's a product word)\n- If NO \u2192 KEEP (it's a brand)\n\n**EXCLUDE:**\n- Any word that passes the Amazon test (products you can buy)\n- Features (wireless, waterproof, slim, RFID)\n- Any [Brand] + [product noun] combination\n\n## Validation Process (MANDATORY)\n\n**For EACH candidate entity, do this check BEFORE adding to output:**\n\n### Step 1: Split entity into words\n`Bose Deep Bass` \u2192 [\"Bose\", \"Deep\", \"Bass\"]\n\n### Step 2: Check the LAST word\nAsk: \"Is [last word] something I can buy, use, or a feature?\"\n\n### Step 3: Decide\n- **If last word is a product/feature** \u2192 REMOVE entire entity\n- **If last word is only the brand name or typo** \u2192 KEEP\n\n### Common product words (things you can buy/use):\ntoys, figure, earbuds, speaker, bass, sound, bottle, wallet, holder, bag, case, organizer, kitchen, bread\n\n### Common features (describe the product):\nwireless, waterproof, deep, slim, RFID, insulated, stainless\n\n### Examples of the Amazon Test in Action\n\n| Entity | Last Word | Amazon Test | Result |\n|--------|-----------|-------------|--------|\n| `Bellroy Wallet` | wallet | Can buy wallets \u2713 | REMOVE |\n| `Transformers Toys` | toys | Can buy toys \u2713 | REMOVE |\n| `Bose Earbuds` | earbuds | Can buy earbuds \u2713 | REMOVE |\n| `Pyrex Kitchen` | kitchen | Can buy kitchen items \u2713 | REMOVE |\n| `Zojirushi Bread` | bread | Can buy bread \u2713 | REMOVE |\n| `Bose Deep Bass` | bass | \"bass\" is audio feature | REMOVE |\n| `Bellroy` | Bellroy | Can't buy \"Bellroy\" alone | KEEP |\n| `PowerIQ` | PowerIQ | Trademarked name | KEEP |\n| `ColorStay` | ColorStay | Trademarked name | KEEP |\n\n## Output Format\n\nOutput validated brand entities with typos (max 10):\n\n```json\n{\"brand_entities\": [\"Brand\", \"brand\", \"Brnad\", \"Bradn\", \"Brandd\", \"SubBrand\", ...]}\n```\n\n**CRITICAL: Each entity must be UNIQUE - no duplicates allowed!**\n\n**Expected output structure:**\n- Original brand name + 3-5 typos (all unique)\n- Lowercase variation (exactly 1)\n- Sub-brand if exists + its typos\n- Manufacturer if different from brand + its typos\n\n### Complete Example\n\n**Input:**\n- brand_name: \"Anker\"\n- manufacturer: \"Belkin\"\n- title: \"Anker PowerIQ Fast Charging USB Wall Charger...\"\n\n**Expected Output:**\n```json\n{\n  \"brand_entities\": [\n    \"Anker\",\n    \"anker\",\n    \"Ankr\",\n    \"Akner\",\n    \"Annker\",\n    \"PowerIQ\",\n    \"poweriq\",\n    \"PwerIQ\",\n    \"Belkin\",\n    \"belkin\"\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n**Why these entities:**\n- `Anker` + 4 typos (lowercase, missing letter, swap, doubled)\n- `PowerIQ` + 2 typos (trademarked sub-brand)\n- `Belkin` + 1 typo (manufacturer, different from brand)\n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\udd34 THINK OF YOUR OUTPUT AS A SET\n\n**Mathematical set = NO DUPLICATES ALLOWED**\n\nYour output array is a **SET**, not a list. In sets, each element can appear only ONCE.\n\nBefore outputting, verify your set is valid:\n- Set `{\"Anker\", \"anker\", \"Annker\", \"Ankr\"}` \u2713 **VALID** - all unique strings\n- Set `{\"Anker\", \"anker\", \"Anker\", \"Ankr\"}` \u2717 **INVALID** - \"Anker\" appears twice\n\n**VALIDATION RULE: If you see ANY string twice in your output, your output is INVALID and you must remove the duplicate.**\n\nMental check process:\n1. Write your list\n2. For EACH string, ask: \"Have I already written this exact string?\"\n3. If YES \u2192 DELETE IT (keep only the first occurrence)\n4. If NO \u2192 Keep it\n\n---\n\n## STOP! Before outputting, verify:\n\n1. **NO DUPLICATES** - Scan your list: if any entity appears more than once, REMOVE the duplicate\n2. **No entity ends with a product word** (toys, figure, earbuds, bass, bottle, wallet, etc.)\n3. **No entity ends with a feature** (wireless, deep, slim, RFID)\n4. **No concatenated forms** (BoseSoundProEarbuds \u2192 wrong, use \"Bose\" and \"Sound Pro\" separately)\n5. **Max 1-2 words per entity** (except known trademarks like \"The North Face\")\n\n**DUPLICATE CHECK (MANDATORY):**\nBefore returning, mentally scan: \"Is 'X' already in my list?\" for EACH entity you add.\nExample BAD output: `[\"Bose\", \"bose\", \"Bose\", \"Sound\"]` - \"Bose\" appears twice \u2192 REMOVE one\n\n## Quick Reference\n\n**Always remove if last word is a common noun like:**\n- Things you wear/carry: wallet, bag, case, holder, jacket, shoes\n- Kitchen items: bottle, organizer, caddy, tray, maker\n- Electronics: phone, earbuds, speaker, charger\n- Food: bread, snacks, drinks\n- Any physical product category\n\n**Always keep:**\n- Brand names: Bellroy, Pyrex, Anker, Bose\n- Typos of brand names: Bellroyy, Annker, Bsoe\n- Trademarked product lines: PowerIQ, ColorStay\n\n---\n\n## FINAL CHECK: Remove any duplicates from your output array before returning!\n",

(trademark, company name)\n**Product Word** = WHAT is this? (thing you can buy)\n\n### The Amazon Test\n\nFor each word, ask: **\"Can I search Amazon and buy a [word] as a standalone product?\"**\n\n- \"wallet\" \u2192 Yes, you can buy a wallet \u2192 **PRODUCT WORD** \u2192 exclude\n- \"bottle\" \u2192 Yes, you can buy a bottle \u2192 **PRODUCT WORD** \u2192 exclude\n- \"kitchen\" \u2192 Yes, you can buy kitchen items \u2192 **PRODUCT WORD** \u2192 exclude\n- \"bread\" \u2192 Yes, you can buy bread \u2192 **PRODUCT WORD** \u2192 exclude\n- \"Anker\" \u2192 No, Anker is a brand name \u2192 **BRAND ENTITY** \u2192 include\n- \"PowerIQ\" \u2192 No, it's a trademarked product line \u2192 **BRAND ENTITY** \u2192 include\n\n### \ud83d\udd34 CRITICAL: Apply Amazon Test to EVERY word in multi-word entities\n\nWhen you have a sub-brand like \"[Brand] [SubBrand]\", you MUST test EACH word:\n\n1. Test \"[SubBrand]\" alone: Can you buy a \"[SubBrand]\" on Amazon?\n   - If \"[SubBrand]\" is a common word \u2192 **REMOVE the entire entity**\n   - If \"[SubBrand]\" is ONLY used as this brand's trademark \u2192 **KEEP**\n\n**Common words that FAIL the Amazon Test when used in sub-brands:**\n- beam, wave, pro, max, plus, ultra \u2192 generic product modifiers\n- bass, sound, audio, noise \u2192 audio/electronics terms\n- fresh, pure, clean, clear \u2192 descriptive adjectives\n- sport, active, fit, flex \u2192 lifestyle terms\n\n**Rule: If the last word of a sub-brand is a dictionary word with meaning outside this brand, EXCLUDE the entire sub-brand entity.**\n\n**Examples:**\n| Sub-brand | Last Word Test | Decision |\n|-----------|---------------|----------|\n| `Bose Deep Bass` | \"bass\" = audio term | \u274c REMOVE |\n| `Bose Sound Pro` | \"pro\" = generic modifier | \u274c REMOVE |\n| `Anker PowerIQ` | \"PowerIQ\" = unique trademark | \u2705 KEEP |\n| `ColorStay` | unique trademark | \u2705 KEEP |\n\n### \ud83d\udeab DO NOT Extract Partial Sub-Brands\n\n**When a multi-word sub-brand fails the Amazon Test, skip the ENTIRE concept:**\n\n\u274c **WRONG approach:**\n1. See \"Sound Pro\" in title\n2. Test \u2192 \"pro\" is generic \u2192 reject \"Sound Pro\"\n3. Think \"maybe Sound alone is valid\" \u2192 extract \"Sound\" \u2190 **WRONG!**\n\n\u2705 **CORRECT approach:**\n1. See \"Sound Pro\" in title\n2. Test \u2192 \"pro\" is generic \u2192 reject ENTIRE \"Sound Pro\" concept\n3. Do NOT extract \"Sound\" separately\n4. Only extract the main brand (e.g., \"Bose\")\n\n**Why?** If \"Word1 Word2\" was meant as a product line name, extracting just \"Word1\" loses the trademark context. \"Sound\" alone is generic and meaningless without \"Pro\".\n\n### Critical Rule\n\n**If your entity is [Brand] + [Product Word], ONLY keep the brand part.**\n\nExamples:\n- `Bellroy Wallet` \u2192 \"wallet\" passes Amazon test \u2192 keep only `Bellroy`\n- `Pyrex Kitchen` \u2192 \"kitchen\" passes Amazon test \u2192 keep only `Pyrex`\n- `PowerIQ Charger` \u2192 \"charger\" passes Amazon test \u2192 keep only `PowerIQ`\n\n## Inputs\n\n- **brand_name**: Transformers\n- **title**: Transformers Toys Heroic Optimus Prime Action Figure - Timeless Large-Scale Figure, Changes into Toy Truck - Toys for Kids 6 and Up, 11-inch (Amazon Exclusive)\n- **bullet_points**: EXPERIENCE THE CLASSIC CONVERSION PLAY OF TRANSFORMERS TOYS: Transformers toys that change from robot to vehicle have captivated kids for generations.\n2 TOYS IN 1: This toy robot changes into the signature red and blue Optimus Prime toy truck in 6 simple steps.

Transformers and all related characters are trademarks of Hasbro.\n- **manufacturer**: Hasbro\n\n## Step-by-Step Extraction Process\n\n### Step 1: Identify Brand Elements\n1. **Brand Name**: The official brand from inputs\n2. **Manufacturer**: If different from brand name\n3. **Sub-brands**: Trademarked product lines (e.g., \"PowerIQ\", \"ColorStay\")\n\n### Step 1.5: Handle Multi-Word Brand Names\n\n**For brand names with multiple words (e.g., \"Hydro Flask\"), extract ALL forms:**\n\n| Form | Example for \"Hydro Flask\" | Why include? |\n|------|---------------------------|--------------|\n| **Full with space** | `Hydro Flask` | Original brand spelling |\n| **Full lowercase** | `hydro flask` | Case-insensitive search |\n| **Merged** | `HydroFlask` | How customers type without space |\n| **Merged lowercase** | `hydroflask` | Combined variation |\n| **First word** | `Hydro` | Customers often search first word only |\n| **First word lowercase** | `hydro` | Case variation |\n\n**Why extract first word separately?**\n- Customers often remember and search by the first/main word only\n- This captures more search traffic for PPC campaigns\n- Example: \"Hydro Flask\" \u2192 customers commonly search just \"Hydro\" or \"hydro\"\n\n**Apply typo generation to:**\n- The merged form (`HydroFlask` \u2192 `HydrFlask`, `HydroFalsk`)\n- The first word if 3+ characters (`Hydro` \u2192 `Hydr`, `Hydor`)\n\n**Note:** This rule applies to brand_name from input, NOT to sub-brands identified in title.\n\n### Step 2: Generate Typos (MANDATORY - 4-6 UNIQUE per brand)\n\nFor EACH brand element, generate DIVERSE misspellings. **Prioritize phonetic typos over case changes.**\n\n| Typo Type | Priority | How to Apply |\n|-----------|----------|--------------|\n| **Missing letter** | \ud83d\udd34 HIGH | Remove vowel/consonant: Anker\u2192`Ankr`, Bellroy\u2192`Belroy` |\n| **Swapped adjacent** | \ud83d\udd34 HIGH | Swap 2 adjacent letters: Anker\u2192`Akner`, Bellroy\u2192`Bellory` |\n| **Phonetic substitution** | \ud83d\udd34 HIGH | Similar sound: y\u2192ie, c\u2192s, ph\u2192f: Pyrex\u2192`Pirex` |\n| **Doubled letter** | \ud83d\udfe1 MEDIUM | Double vowel/consonant: Anker\u2192`Annker` |\n| **Wrong vowel** | \ud83d\udfe1 MEDIUM | Vowel confusion a\u2194e, i\u2194y, o\u2194u: Bellroy\u2192`Bellray` |\n| **Case variation** | \ud83d\udfe2 LOW | **Only ONE lowercase per brand**: Anker\u2192`anker` |\n| **With space** | \ud83d\udfe2 LOW | For compounds only: KitchenAid\u2192`Kitchen Aid` |\n\n**\ud83d\udd34 TYPO GENERATION RULES:**\n1. Generate **EXACTLY 1** case variant (lowercase) - no more!\n2. Generate **3-5 DIFFERENT** spelling/phonetic typos\n3. Each typo must be **UNIQUE** - check before adding\n4. Focus on mistakes real customers make when typing fast\n\n**Example typo generation (following priority):**\n- Brand \"Bellroy\" \u2192 `Bellroy`, `bellroy`(case), `Belroy`(missing), `Bellory`(swap), `Bellray`(vowel)\n- Brand \"Pyrex\" \u2192 `Pyrex`, `pyrex`(case), `Prex`(missing), `Pirex`(phonetic), `Pyerx`(swap)\n- Brand \"Bose\" \u2192 `Bose`, `bose`(case), `Bsoe`(swap), `Bosee`(doubled)\n\n### \ud83d\udd34 ANTI-HALLUCINATION CONSTRAINT (CRITICAL)\n\n**Each typo must be traceable to EXACTLY ONE edit operation from the original brand.**\n\nValid single-edit operations:\n1. **Double ONE existing letter**: Pyrex \u2192 Pyrrex (doubled 'r')\n2. **Drop ONE letter**: Pyrex \u2192 Prex (dropped 'y')\n3. **Swap TWO adjacent letters**: Pyrex \u2192 Pyerx (swapped 're')\n4. **Replace with keyboard-adjacent key**: Pyrex \u2192 Pytex (r\u2192t adjacent)\n5. **Replace with phonetically similar**: Pyrex \u2192 Pirex (y\u2192i similar sound)\n\n**\ud83d\udeab FORBIDDEN (These are HALLUCINATIONS):**\n- Adding letters not in original AND not keyboard-adjacent: Pyrex \u2192 Pyrexx \u274c (extra 'x' not justified)\n- Multiple simultaneous edits: Pyrex \u2192 Prx \u274c (two letters removed)\n- Inventing new letter combinations: Bellroy \u2192 Bellrizza \u274c\n- Any output not derivable from brand_name input\n\n**VALIDATION: Before outputting each typo, ask: \"Can I explain this typo with ONE edit rule?\"**\n- If YES \u2192 Keep it\n- If NO \u2192 It's a hallucination \u2192 REMOVE IT\n\n### Step 3: Validate Each Entity (Amazon Test)\nBefore adding to output, check: \"Can I buy [last word] on Amazon?\"\n- If YES \u2192 REMOVE (it's a product word)\n- If NO \u2192 KEEP (it's a brand)\n\n**EXCLUDE:**\n- Any word that passes the Amazon test (products you can buy)\n- Features (wireless, waterproof, slim, RFID)\n- Any [Brand] + [product noun] combination\n\n## Validation Process (MANDATORY)\n\n**For EACH candidate entity, do this check BEFORE adding to output:**\n\n### Step 1: Split entity into words\n`Bose Deep Bass` \u2192 [\"Bose\", \"Deep\", \"Bass\"]\n\n### Step 2: Check the LAST word\nAsk: \"Is [last word] something I can buy, use, or a feature?\"\n\n### Step 3: Decide\n- **If last word is a product/feature** \u2192 REMOVE entire entity\n- **If last word is only the brand name or typo** \u2192 KEEP\n\n### Common product words (things you can buy/use):\ntoys, figure, earbuds, speaker, bass, sound, bottle, wallet, holder, bag, case, organizer, kitchen, bread\n\n### Common features (describe the product):\nwireless, waterproof, deep, slim, RFID, insulated, stainless\n\n### Examples of the Amazon Test in Action\n\n| Entity | Last Word | Amazon Test | Result |\n|--------|-----------|-------------|--------|\n| `Bellroy Wallet` | wallet | Can buy wallets \u2713 | REMOVE |\n| `Transformers Toys` | toys | Can buy toys \u2713 | REMOVE |\n| `Bose Earbuds` | earbuds | Can buy earbuds \u2713 | REMOVE |\n| `Pyrex Kitchen` | kitchen | Can buy kitchen items \u2713 | REMOVE |\n| `Zojirushi Bread` | bread | Can buy bread \u2713 | REMOVE |\n| `Bose Deep Bass` | bass | \"bass\" is audio feature | REMOVE |\n| `Bellroy` | Bellroy | Can't buy \"Bellroy\" alone | KEEP |\n| `PowerIQ` | PowerIQ | Trademarked name | KEEP |\n| `ColorStay` | ColorStay | Trademarked name | KEEP |\n\n## Output Format\n\nOutput validated brand entities with typos (max 10):\n\n```json\n{\"brand_entities\": [\"Brand\", \"brand\", \"Brnad\", \"Bradn\", \"Brandd\", \"SubBrand\", ...]}\n```\n\n**CRITICAL: Each entity must be UNIQUE - no duplicates allowed!**\n\n**Expected output structure:**\n- Original brand name + 3-5 typos (all unique)\n- Lowercase variation (exactly 1)\n- Sub-brand if exists + its typos\n- Manufacturer if different from brand + its typos\n\n### Complete Example\n\n**Input:**\n- brand_name: \"Anker\"\n- manufacturer: \"Belkin\"\n- title: \"Anker PowerIQ Fast Charging USB Wall Charger...\"\n\n**Expected Output:**\n```json\n{\n  \"brand_entities\": [\n    \"Anker\",\n    \"anker\",\n    \"Ankr\",\n    \"Akner\",\n    \"Annker\",\n    \"PowerIQ\",\n    \"poweriq\",\n    \"PwerIQ\",\n    \"Belkin\",\n    \"belkin\"\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n**Why these entities:**\n- `Anker` + 4 typos (lowercase, missing letter, swap, doubled)\n- `PowerIQ` + 2 typos (trademarked sub-brand)\n- `Belkin` + 1 typo (manufacturer, different from brand)\n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\udd34 THINK OF YOUR OUTPUT AS A SET\n\n**Mathematical set = NO DUPLICATES ALLOWED**\n\nYour output array is a **SET**, not a list.

(trademark, company name)\n**Product Word** = WHAT is this? (thing you can buy)\n\n### The Amazon Test\n\nFor each word, ask: **\"Can I search Amazon and buy a [word] as a standalone product?\"**\n\n- \"wallet\" \u2192 Yes, you can buy a wallet \u2192 **PRODUCT WORD** \u2192 exclude\n- \"bottle\" \u2192 Yes, you can buy a bottle \u2192 **PRODUCT WORD** \u2192 exclude\n- \"kitchen\" \u2192 Yes, you can buy kitchen items \u2192 **PRODUCT WORD** \u2192 exclude\n- \"bread\" \u2192 Yes, you can buy bread \u2192 **PRODUCT WORD** \u2192 exclude\n- \"Anker\" \u2192 No, Anker is a brand name \u2192 **BRAND ENTITY** \u2192 include\n- \"PowerIQ\" \u2192 No, it's a trademarked product line \u2192 **BRAND ENTITY** \u2192 include\n\n### \ud83d\udd34 CRITICAL: Apply Amazon Test to EVERY word in multi-word entities\n\nWhen you have a sub-brand like \"[Brand] [SubBrand]\", you MUST test EACH word:\n\n1. Test \"[SubBrand]\" alone: Can you buy a \"[SubBrand]\" on Amazon?\n   - If \"[SubBrand]\" is a common word \u2192 **REMOVE the entire entity**\n   - If \"[SubBrand]\" is ONLY used as this brand's trademark \u2192 **KEEP**\n\n**Common words that FAIL the Amazon Test when used in sub-brands:**\n- beam, wave, pro, max, plus, ultra \u2192 generic product modifiers\n- bass, sound, audio, noise \u2192 audio/electronics terms\n- fresh, pure, clean, clear \u2192 descriptive adjectives\n- sport, active, fit, flex \u2192 lifestyle terms\n\n**Rule: If the last word of a sub-brand is a dictionary word with meaning outside this brand, EXCLUDE the entire sub-brand entity.**\n\n**Examples:**\n| Sub-brand | Last Word Test | Decision |\n|-----------|---------------|----------|\n| `Bose Deep Bass` | \"bass\" = audio term | \u274c REMOVE |\n| `Bose Sound Pro` | \"pro\" = generic modifier | \u274c REMOVE |\n| `Anker PowerIQ` | \"PowerIQ\" = unique trademark | \u2705 KEEP |\n| `ColorStay` | unique trademark | \u2705 KEEP |\n\n### \ud83d\udeab DO NOT Extract Partial Sub-Brands\n\n**When a multi-word sub-brand fails the Amazon Test, skip the ENTIRE concept:**\n\n\u274c **WRONG approach:**\n1. See \"Sound Pro\" in title\n2. Test \u2192 \"pro\" is generic \u2192 reject \"Sound Pro\"\n3. Think \"maybe Sound alone is valid\" \u2192 extract \"Sound\" \u2190 **WRONG!**\n\n\u2705 **CORRECT approach:**\n1. See \"Sound Pro\" in title\n2. Test \u2192 \"pro\" is generic \u2192 reject ENTIRE \"Sound Pro\" concept\n3. Do NOT extract \"Sound\" separately\n4. Only extract the main brand (e.g., \"Bose\")\n\n**Why?** If \"Word1 Word2\" was meant as a product line name, extracting just \"Word1\" loses the trademark context. \"Sound\" alone is generic and meaningless without \"Pro\".\n\n### Critical Rule\n\n**If your entity is [Brand] + [Product Word], ONLY keep the brand part.**\n\nExamples:\n- `Bellroy Wallet` \u2192 \"wallet\" passes Amazon test \u2192 keep only `Bellroy`\n- `Pyrex Kitchen` \u2192 \"kitchen\" passes Amazon test \u2192 keep only `Pyrex`\n- `PowerIQ Charger` \u2192 \"charger\" passes Amazon test \u2192 keep only `PowerIQ`\n\n## Inputs\n\n- **brand_name**: Rx Crush\n- **title**: RxCrush Female ENFit to Female Oral Adapter - QTY 100 100 Standard\n- **bullet_points**: \n- **description**: Oral Standard Bore, EO02 Connects and locks to male ENFit (RxCrush pill pouch) and mates to male Oral syringe. DOES NOT CONNECT TO ENFit SYRINGES.\nAdapter has female ENFit and female Oral ends. Made of ABS material. Warning, if used incorrectly this adapter will fit onto Luer syringes, will leak and introduces a cross connection hazard. USE ONLY WITH ORAL SYRINGES.\nOral Large Bore, EO05 Connects to male ENFit (RxCrush pill pouches) andlarge boremale Oral syringe. DOES NOT CONNECT TO ENFit SYRINGES.\nAdapter has female ENFit (slip fit, does NOT have locking ENFit) and female Oral ends. The oral end is nonstandard so ensure the ID of this adapter fits the OD of your oral syringe. Made of PVC material 0.205 inch ID / 0.268 inch OD (5.2 mm / 6.8 mm), both ends\n- **manufacturer**: Resolve Designs\n\n## Step-by-Step Extraction Process\n\n### Step 1: Identify Brand Elements\n1. **Brand Name**: The official brand from inputs\n2. **Manufacturer**: If different from brand name\n3. **Sub-brands**: Trademarked product lines (e.g., \"PowerIQ\", \"ColorStay\")\n\n### Step 1.5: Handle Multi-Word Brand Names\n\n**For brand names with multiple words (e.g., \"Hydro Flask\"), extract ALL forms:**\n\n| Form | Example for \"Hydro Flask\" | Why include? |\n|------|---------------------------|--------------|\n| **Full with space** | `Hydro Flask` | Original brand spelling |\n| **Full lowercase** | `hydro flask` | Case-insensitive search |\n| **Merged** | `HydroFlask` | How customers type without space |\n| **Merged lowercase** | `hydroflask` | Combined variation |\n| **First word** | `Hydro` | Customers often search first word only |\n| **First word lowercase** | `hydro` | Case variation |\n\n**Why extract first word separately?**\n- Customers often remember and search by the first/main word only\n- This captures more search traffic for PPC campaigns\n- Example: \"Hydro Flask\" \u2192 customers commonly search just \"Hydro\" or \"hydro\"\n\n**Apply typo generation to:**\n- The merged form (`HydroFlask` \u2192 `HydrFlask`, `HydroFalsk`)\n- The first word if 3+ characters (`Hydro` \u2192 `Hydr`, `Hydor`)\n\n**Note:** This rule applies to brand_name from input, NOT to sub-brands identified in title.\n\n### Step 2: Generate Typos (MANDATORY - 4-6 UNIQUE per brand)\n\nFor EACH brand element, generate DIVERSE misspellings. **Prioritize phonetic typos over case changes.**\n\n| Typo Type | Priority | How to Apply |\n|-----------|----------|--------------|\n| **Missing letter** | \ud83d\udd34 HIGH | Remove vowel/consonant: Anker\u2192`Ankr`, Bellroy\u2192`Belroy` |\n| **Swapped adjacent** | \ud83d\udd34 HIGH | Swap 2 adjacent letters: Anker\u2192`Akner`, Bellroy\u2192`Bellory` |\n| **Phonetic substitution** | \ud83d\udd34 HIGH | Similar sound: y\u2192ie, c\u2192s, ph\u2192f: Pyrex\u2192`Pirex` |\n| **Doubled letter** | \ud83d\udfe1 MEDIUM | Double vowel/consonant: Anker\u2192`Annker` |\n| **Wrong vowel** | \ud83d\udfe1 MEDIUM | Vowel confusion a\u2194e, i\u2194y, o\u2194u: Bellroy\u2192`Bellray` |\n| **Case variation** | \ud83d\udfe2 LOW | **Only ONE lowercase per brand**: Anker\u2192`anker` |\n| **With space** | \ud83d\udfe2 LOW | For compounds only: KitchenAid\u2192`Kitchen Aid` |\n\n**\ud83d\udd34 TYPO GENERATION RULES:**\n1. Generate **EXACTLY 1** case variant (lowercase) - no more!\n2. Generate **3-5 DIFFERENT** spelling/phonetic typos\n3. Each typo must be **UNIQUE** - check before adding\n4. Focus on mistakes real customers make when typing fast\n\n**Example typo generation (following priority):**\n- Brand \"Bellroy\" \u2192 `Bellroy`, `bellroy`(case), `Belroy`(missing), `Bellory`(swap), `Bellray`(vowel)\n- Brand \"Pyrex\" \u2192 `Pyrex`, `pyrex`(case), `Prex`(missing), `Pirex`(phonetic), `Pyerx`(swap)\n- Brand \"Bose\" \u2192 `Bose`, `bose`(case), `Bsoe`(swap), `Bosee`(doubled)\n\n### \ud83d\udd34 ANTI-HALLUCINATION CONSTRAINT (CRITICAL)\n\n**Each typo must be traceable to EXACTLY ONE edit operation from the original brand.**\n\nValid single-edit operations:\n1. **Double ONE existing letter**: Pyrex \u2192 Pyrrex (doubled 'r')\n2. **Drop ONE letter**: Pyrex \u2192 Prex (dropped 'y')\n3. **Swap TWO adjacent letters**: Pyrex \u2192 Pyerx (swapped 're')\n4. **Replace with keyboard-adjacent key**: Pyrex \u2192 Pytex (r\u2192t adjacent)\n5. **Replace with phonetically similar**: Pyrex \u2192 Pirex (y\u2192i similar sound)\n\n**\ud83d\udeab FORBIDDEN (These are HALLUCINATIONS):**\n- Adding letters not in original AND not keyboard-adjacent: Pyrex \u2192 Pyrexx \u274c (extra 'x' not justified)\n- Multiple simultaneous edits: Pyrex \u2192 Prx \u274c (two letters removed)\n- Inventing new letter combinations: Bellroy \u2192 Bellrizza \u274c\n- Any output not derivable from brand_name input\n\n**VALIDATION: Before outputting each typo, ask: \"Can I explain this typo with ONE edit rule?\"**\n- If YES \u2192 Keep it\n- If NO \u2192 It's a hallucination \u2192 REMOVE IT\n\n### Step 3: Validate Each Entity (Amazon Test)\nBefore adding to output, check: \"Can I buy [last word] on Amazon?\"\n- If YES \u2192 REMOVE (it's a product word)\n- If NO \u2192 KEEP (it's a brand)\n\n**EXCLUDE:**\n- Any word that passes the Amazon test (products you can buy)\n- Features (wireless, waterproof, slim, RFID)\n- Any [Brand] + [product noun] combination\n\n## Validation Process (MANDATORY)\n\n**For EACH candidate entity, do this check BEFORE adding to output:**\n\n### Step 1: Split entity into words\n`Bose Deep Bass` \u2192 [\"Bose\", \"Deep\", \"Bass\"]\n\n### Step 2: Check the LAST word\nAsk: \"Is [last word] something I can buy, use, or a feature?\"\n\n### Step 3: Decide\n- **If last word is a product/feature** \u2192 REMOVE entire entity\n- **If last word is only the brand name or typo** \u2192 KEEP\n\n### Common product words (things you can buy/use):\ntoys, figure, earbuds, speaker, bass, sound, bottle, wallet, holder, bag, case, organizer, kitchen, bread\n\n### Common features (describe the product):\nwireless, waterproof, deep, slim, RFID, insulated, stainless\n\n### Examples of the Amazon Test in Action\n\n| Entity | Last Word | Amazon Test | Result |\n|--------|-----------|-------------|--------|\n| `Bellroy Wallet` | wallet | Can buy wallets \u2713 | REMOVE |\n| `Transformers Toys` | toys | Can buy toys \u2713 | REMOVE |\n| `Bose Earbuds` | earbuds | Can buy earbuds \u2713 | REMOVE |\n| `Pyrex Kitchen` | kitchen | Can buy kitchen items \u2713 | REMOVE |\n| `Zojirushi Bread` | bread | Can buy bread \u2713 | REMOVE |\n| `Bose Deep Bass` | bass | \"bass\" is audio feature | REMOVE |\n| `Bellroy` | Bellroy | Can't buy \"Bellroy\" alone | KEEP |\n| `PowerIQ` | PowerIQ | Trademarked name | KEEP |\n| `ColorStay` | ColorStay | Trademarked name | KEEP |\n\n## Output Format\n\nOutput validated brand entities with typos (max 10):\n\n```json\n{\"brand_entities\": [\"Brand\", \"brand\", \"Brnad\", \"Bradn\", \"Brandd\", \"SubBrand\", ...]}\n```\n\n**CRITICAL: Each entity must be UNIQUE - no duplicates allowed!**\n\n**Expected output structure:**\n- Original brand name + 3-5 typos (all unique)\n- Lowercase variation (exactly 1)\n- Sub-brand if exists + its typos\n- Manufacturer if different from brand + its typos\n\n### Complete Example\n\n**Input:**\n- brand_name: \"Anker\"\n- manufacturer: \"Belkin\"\n- title: \"Anker PowerIQ Fast Charging USB Wall Charger...\"\n\n**Expected Output:**\n```json\n{\n  \"brand_entities\": [\n    \"Anker\",\n    \"anker\",\n    \"Ankr\",\n    \"Akner\",\n    \"Annker\",\n    \"PowerIQ\",\n    \"poweriq\",\n    \"PwerIQ\",\n    \"Belkin\",\n    \"belkin\"\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n**Why these entities:**\n- `Anker` + 4 typos (lowercase, missing letter, swap, doubled)\n- `PowerIQ` + 2 typos (trademarked sub-brand)\n- `Belkin` + 1 typo (manufacturer, different from brand)\n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\udd34 THINK OF YOUR OUTPUT AS A SET\n\n**Mathematical set = NO DUPLICATES ALLOWED**\n\nYour output array is a **SET**, not a list. In sets, each element can appear only ONCE.\n\nBefore outputting, verify your set is valid:\n- Set `{\"Anker\", \"anker\", \"Annker\", \"Ankr\"}` \u2713 **VALID** - all unique strings\n- Set `{\"Anker\", \"anker\", \"Anker\", \"Ankr\"}` \u2717 **INVALID** - \"Anker\" appears twice\n\n**VALIDATION RULE: If you see ANY string twice in your output, your output is INVALID and you must remove the duplicate.**\n\nMental check process:\n1. Write your list\n2. For EACH string, ask: \"Have I already written this exact string?\"\n3. If YES \u2192 DELETE IT (keep only the first occurrence)\n4. If NO \u2192 Keep it\n\n---\n\n## STOP! Before outputting, verify:\n\n1. **NO DUPLICATES** - Scan your list: if any entity appears more than once, REMOVE the duplicate\n2. **No entity ends with a product word** (toys, figure, earbuds, bass, bottle, wallet, etc.)\n3. **No entity ends with a feature** (wireless, deep, slim, RFID)\n4. **No concatenated forms** (BoseSoundProEarbuds \u2192 wrong, use \"Bose\" and \"Sound Pro\" separately)\n5. **Max 1-2 words per entity** (except known trademarks like \"The North Face\")\n\n**DUPLICATE CHECK (MANDATORY):**\nBefore returning, mentally scan: \"Is 'X' already in my list?\" for EACH entity you add.\nExample BAD output: `[\"Bose\", \"bose\", \"Bose\", \"Sound\"]` - \"Bose\" appears twice \u2192 REMOVE one\n\n## Quick Reference\n\n**Always remove if last word is a common noun like:**\n- Things you wear/carry: wallet, bag, case, holder, jacket, shoes\n- Kitchen items: bottle, organizer, caddy, tray, maker\n- Electronics: phone, earbuds, speaker, charger\n- Food: bread, snacks, drinks\n- Any physical product category\n\n**Always keep:**\n- Brand names: Bellroy, Pyrex, Anker, Bose\n- Typos of brand names: Bellroyy, Annker, Bsoe\n- Trademarked product lines: PowerIQ, ColorStay\n\n---\n\n## FINAL CHECK: Remove any duplicates from your output array before returning!\n",
