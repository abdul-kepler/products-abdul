# M11 Module Context: Identify Hard Constraints

## Module Purpose
Determine which product attributes are non-negotiable for the product to function.

## Critical Rule: The 99% Rule
**99% of consumer products have ZERO hard constraints.**

Before identifying ANY hard constraint, apply this test:
> "Would a basic $1 version of this product category STILL perform the core function?"

## NEVER Hard Constraints (Red Flags)

### Technology Versions
- Bluetooth 5.2, WiFi 6, USB 3.0 → NEVER hard

### Durability Features
- Waterproof, Rustproof, Long-lasting → NEVER hard

### Performance Specs
- 32hr battery, 26lbs/day, 500F rating → NEVER hard

### Materials
- Stainless Steel, Silicone, Bamboo → NEVER hard

### Quality Markers
- Premium, Sturdy, Hospital Grade → NEVER hard

## The 3-Step Test

### Step 1: Complete Removal Test
> "If this attribute were COMPLETELY ABSENT, would the product be PHYSICALLY UNABLE to perform its core function?"

Key: PHYSICALLY UNABLE - not "worse", not "less effective", but UNABLE.

### Step 2: Mechanism vs Quality Filter
> "Is this THE MECHANISM that enables function, or a QUALITY MODIFIER?"

| Type | Hard Constraint? |
|------|------------------|
| MECHANISM | Maybe (rare) |
| QUALITY | NEVER |
| DURABILITY | NEVER |
| PERFORMANCE | NEVER |

### Step 3: Basic Product Check
> "Does a basic $1 version of this product category have this attribute?"

If basic version lacks it → NOT a hard constraint

## Expected Distribution

| Count | Products |
|-------|----------|
| **0** | Earbuds, water bottles, jackets, trays, makeup, toys, organizers |
| **1** | Phone cases (device fit), oven mitts (heat resist), cables (connector) |
| **2+** | Almost never - review carefully |

## Valid Hard Constraints (Rare)

1. **Device Compatibility**: iPhone 15 Pro case MUST fit iPhone 15 Pro
2. **Safety Mechanisms**: Oven mitt MUST have heat resistance
3. **Physical Connectors**: USB-C cable MUST have USB-C connector

## Evaluation Focus

When evaluating M11 output, check:
1. Is the constraint count appropriate? (usually 0)
2. Are any NEVER category items included? (should be 0)
3. Was the 3-step test applied in reasoning?
4. Does output align with validated use?
5. If constraints exist, are they MECHANISMS, not QUALITY?
