Up to 32 Hours Battery Life: If removed, the earbuds would still function with a shorter battery life (e.g., 8 hours) - PERFORMANCE SPEC, NOT hard constraint. 4. Water and Dust Resistant: If removed, the earbuds would still function and produce sound, just not be protected from water and dust - DURABILITY feature, NOT hard constraint. 5.

NO - even at a lower rating (e.g., 400F), it can still provide heat protection. This is a QUALITY modifier, not a hard constraint. Waterproof Silicone: Remove entirely? NO - other materials can still provide heat protection, so this is a MATERIAL choice. NOT hard. Slip-Resistant Grip: Remove entirely? NO - the mitt can still provide heat protection without a slip-resistant grip, making this a CONVENIENCE feature. NOT hard. 2-Pack: Remove entirely? NO - the product can still function with one mitt, so this is a quantity feature. NOT hard. 7\"x13\": Remove entirely? NO - the mitt can still function in a different size, making this a SIZE specification. NOT hard. Charcoal Grey: Remove entirely? NO - the color does not affect functionality, so this is an AESTHETIC choice. NOT hard. Cotton Lining: Remove entirely? NO - the mitt can still function without the cotton lining, making this a MATERIAL choice. NOT hard. Conclusion: 1 hard constraint."
