Up to 32 Hours Battery Life: If removed, the earbuds would still function with a shorter battery life (e.g., 8 hours) - PERFORMANCE SPEC, NOT hard constraint. 4. Water and Dust Resistant: If removed, the earbuds would still function and produce sound, just not be protected from water and dust - DURABILITY feature, NOT hard constraint. 5.
